The Trump administration has drafted a sweeping revision of the government’s contraception coverage mandate that could deny birth control benefits to hundreds of thousands of women who now receive them at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.The new rule, which could go into effect as soon as it is published in the Federal Register, greatly expands the number of employers and insurers that could qualify for exemptions from the mandate by claiming a moral or religious objection, including for-profit, publicly traded corporations.
A 34,000-word explanation of the intended policy change is blunt about its likely impact on women: “These interim final rules will result in some enrollees in plans of exempt entities not receiving coverage or payments for contraceptive services.”
The architects of the Affordable Care Act intended to broadly expand access to contraception by making it a regular benefit of health insurance, and the Obama administration’s goal was to guarantee birth control for as many women as possible.
More than 55 million women have birth control coverage without out-of-pocket costs, according to a study commissioned by the Obama administration and cited in the draft rule.
By spring 2014, two-thirds of women using birth control pills and nearly 75 percent of women using the contraceptive ring were no longer paying out-of-pocket costs.
In 2013 alone, the mandate had saved women $1.4 billion on birth control pills, according to the National Women’s Law Center.
But a series of lawsuits filed over the last five years by priests, nuns, charitable organizations, hospitals, advocacy groups and colleges and universities convinced Trump administration officials that a change was needed.
The new rule, drafted mainly by political appointees at the White House and the Health and Human Services Department, seeks “to better balance the interests” of women with those of employers and insurers that have conscientious objections to providing or facilitating access to contraceptives.
“The government does not have a compelling interest in applying the mandate to employers that object” or in foisting coverage on individuals who object, the draft rule states.
Career government employees at the Health and Human Services Department and other agencies do not expect to block the new rule but — in an expedited internal review — they are trying to tone down language that questions the value of contraception.
The Obama administration and the National Academy of Sciences cited studies showing that as the use of contraceptives has gone up, the rate of unintended pregnancies has come down.
But the Trump administration says “these studies are insufficient to demonstrate a causal link.”
Instead, the rule emphasized another issue: “as contraception became available and its use increased, teen sexual activity outside of marriage likewise increased.”
In any event, the Trump administration says, the coverage of contraceptives is required not by the Affordable Care Act itself, but by federal guidelines issued under the law, and the law “does not require that the guidelines be ‘evidence-based’ or ‘evidence-informed.’
” The draft rule is still under review by the administration.
But as its details became known this week, the administration sped up efforts to clear it for publication before opponents could gain traction.
The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, called it a “sickening plan to roll back women’s access to contraception.”
When President Trump ordered his cabinet to consider rule changes to address “conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate” on May 4, he said he was coming to the rescue of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a 178-year-old religious order that had refused to help provide contraceptive coverage.
But the draft rule goes far beyond that.
The Obama administration offered an exemption to houses of worship and a more limited “accommodation” to certain employers who had religious objections to providing or paying for contraceptive coverage.
The Trump administration would offer exemptions to employers that object based on either religious beliefs or sincerely held “moral convictions.”
Most lawsuits attacking the mandate assert that it violates a 1993 law protecting religious liberty.
The Trump administration acknowledges that the law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, “does not provide protection for nonreligious, moral conscientious objections.”
But, it said, Congress and the courts have long recognized the importance of respecting moral convictions as well as religious beliefs, in health care and other fields, and as an example it cited the exemption from military service available to certain “conscientious objectors.”
And it noted that an early version of the First Amendment, proposed by James Madison, protected not only freedom of religion, but also “the full and equal rights of conscience.”
In 2014, the Supreme Court struck down the contraceptive coverage mandate “as applied to closely held corporations” like Hobby Lobby, a for-profit chain of craft stores owned by members of a Christian family who object to certain methods of contraception on religious grounds.
The Supreme Court did not decide whether the religious freedom law applied to publicly traded, for-profit corporations.
But the Trump administration says such companies should have the same protections.
The draft rule would make the exemption available to for-profit as well as nonprofit entities, regardless of whether they are closely held or publicly traded.
The legal concept of a closely held company “is not well-defined or universally-accepted” and is “too imprecise” to be used in the birth control rule, the Trump administration says.
For that reason, the administration says, it will “exempt any entity possessing religious beliefs or moral convictions against the coverage required by the mandate, regardless of its corporate structure or ownership interests.”
The draft rule would also create an exemption for health insurance companies that have religious or moral objections to covering birth control.
It would change the current accommodation for certain religiously affiliated employers from mandatory to optional.
And it would allow insurers and employers to provide a separate insurance policy excluding coverage of contraceptives to individuals who have religious or moral objections.
The Trump administration discounts the possibility of harm to women, saying they can obtain access to contraceptives through a family member’s health plan, a plan sold on a public insurance exchange or “multiple other federal programs that provide free or subsidized contraceptives.”
The draft rule provides not just a handful of talking points, but a detailed analysis of the relevant law and policy, in anticipation of a legal fight with women’s rights advocates.
Under pressure from religious objectors, the Obama administration repeatedly revised its birth control rules, and the Trump administration cites these changes to show that the government has broad discretion to decide who is exempt from the mandate.
Federal law generally requires agencies to issue new rules as proposals, with an opportunity for public comment, but the new rule is labeled an interim final rule, meaning it could take effect immediately on publication in the Federal Register.
Objecting employers urgently need relief, the administration said, and “it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to engage in full notice-and-comment rule-making.”
President Trump has managed to turn America First into America Isolated.In pulling out of the Paris climate accord, Mr. Trump has created a vacuum of global leadership that presents ripe opportunities to allies and adversaries alike to reorder the world’s power structure.
His decision is perhaps the greatest strategic gift to the Chinese, who are eager to fill the void that Washington is leaving around the world on everything from setting the rules of trade and environmental standards to financing the infrastructure projects that give Beijing vast influence.
Mr. Trump’s remarks in the Rose Garden on Thursday were also a retreat from leadership on the one issue, climate change, that unified America’s European allies, its rising superpower competitor in the Pacific, and even some of its adversaries, including Iran.
He did it over the objections of much of the American business community and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, who embraced the Paris accord when he ran Exxon Mobil, less out of a sense of moral responsibility and more as part of the new price of doing business around the world.
As Mr. Trump announced his decision, the Paris agreement’s goals were conspicuously reaffirmed by friends and rivals alike, including nations where it would have the most impact, like China and India, as well as the major European Union states and Russia.
The announcement came only days after he declined to give his NATO allies a forceful reaffirmation of America’s commitment to their security, and a few months after he abandoned a trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that was designed to put the United States at the center of a trade group that would compete with — and, some argue, contain — China’s fast-growing economic might.
“The irony here is that people worried that Trump would come in and make the world safe for Russian meddling,” said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was briefly considered, then rejected, for a top post in the new administration.
“He may yet do that,” Mr. Haass added, “but he has certainly made the world safe for Chinese influence.”
The president, and his defenders, argue that such views are held by an elite group of globalists who have lost sight of the essential element of American power: economic growth.
Mr. Trump made that argument explicitly in the Rose Garden with his contention that the Paris accord amounted to nothing more than “a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.”
In short, he turned the concept of the agreement on its head.
While President Barack Obama argued that the United Nations Green Climate Fund — a financial institution to help poorer nations combat the effects of climate change — would benefit the world, Mr. Trump argued that the American donations to the fund, which he halted, would beggar the country.
“Our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty,” Mr. Trump said.
That, in short, encapsulates how Mr. Trump’s view of preserving American power differs from all of his predecessors, back to President Harry S. Truman.
His proposed cuts to contributions to the United Nations and to American foreign aid are based on a presumption that only economic and military power count.
“Soft power” — investments in alliances and broader global projects — are, in his view, designed to drain influence, not add to it, evident in the fact that he did not include the State Department among the agencies that are central to national security, and thus require budget increases.
It will take years to determine the long-term effects of his decision to abandon the Paris agreement, to the environment and to the global order.
It will not break alliances: Europe is hardly about to embrace a broken, corrupt Russia, and China’s neighbors are simultaneously drawn to its immense wealth and repelled by its self-interested ambitions.
But Mr. Trump has added to the arguments of leaders around the world that it is time to rebalance their portfolios by effectively selling some of their stock in Washington.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has already announced her plan to hedge her bets, declaring last weekend after meeting Mr. Trump that she had realized “the times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent, over.”
That may be temporary: It is still possible that Mr. Trump’s announcement on Thursday will amount to a blip in history, a withdrawal that takes so long — four years — that it could be reversed after the next presidential election.
But for now it leaves the United States declaring that it is better outside the accord than in, a position that, besides America, has so far only been taken by Syria and Nicaragua.
(Syria did not sign on because it is locked in civil war, Nicaragua because it believes the world’s richest nations did not sacrifice enough.)
But it is the relative power balance with China that absorbs anyone who studies the dance of great powers.
Even before Mr. Trump’s announcement, President Xi Jinping had figured out how to embrace the rhetoric, if not the substance, of global leadership.
Mr. Xi is no free trader, and his nation has overtaken the United States as the greatest emitter of carbon by a factor of two.
Only three years ago, it was a deal between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi that laid the groundwork for what became the broader Paris agreement.
Yet for months the Chinese president has been stepping unto the breach, including giving speeches at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that made it sound like China alone was ready to adopt the role of global standard-setter that Washington has occupied since the end of World War II.
“What the Paris accord represented, in a fractured world, was finally some international consensus, led by two big polluters, China and the United States, on a common course of action,” said Graham T. Allison, the author of a new book, “Destined For War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?” “What you’d expect us to do is sustain our position by maintaining our most important relationship around the world and address what the citizens of our allies consider their most important problems: economic growth and an environment that sustains their children and grandchildren,’’ he added.
“Instead, we are absenting the field.”
That sentiment was evident on Thursday in Berlin.
Just hours before Mr. Trump spoke, China’s premier, Li Keqiang, stood alongside Ms. Merkel, and used careful words as he described China as a champion of the accord.
China believed that fighting climate change was an “international responsibility,” Mr. Li said, the kind of declaration that American diplomats have made for years when making the case to combat terrorism or nuclear proliferation or hunger.
China has long viewed the possibility of a partnership with Europe as a balancing strategy against the United States.
Now, with Mr. Trump questioning the basis of NATO, the Chinese are hoping that their partnership with Europe on the climate accord may allow that relationship to come to fruition faster than their grand strategy imagined.
Naturally, the Chinese are using the biggest weapon in their quiver: Money.
Their plan, known as “One Belt, One Road,” is meant to buy China influence from Ethiopia to Britain, from Malaysia to Hungary, all the while refashioning the global economic order.
Mr. Xi announced the sweeping initiative last month, envisioning spending $1 trillion on huge infrastructure projects across Africa, Asia and Europe.
It is a plan with echoes of the Marshall Plan and other American efforts at aid and investment, but on a scale with little precedent in modern history.
And the clear subtext is that it is past time to toss out the rules of aging, American-dominated international institutions, and to conduct commerce on China’s terms.
In making his case for abandoning the Paris climate accord, President Trump characterized the agreement as an economic straitjacketone that would impose terrible burdens on Americans by shuttering the coal industry, suffocating growth and redistributing jobs and wealth from the United States to its competitors.One thing Mr. Trump did not do in the Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon was question the underlying science behind climate change.
Indeed, the president suggested the 194-nation accord did not go far enough in stemming the rise in global temperatures because of greenhouse gas emissions.
But the president’s address — a mix of dry statistics and emotive language — was designed to discredit the pact, point by point.
And several of Mr. Trump’s claims either relied on dubious data or distorted research reports.
Mr. Trump’s argument started with a faulty premise — that emissions reductions under the Paris agreement are compulsory — even though at one point he acknowledged they were voluntary.
“The United States,” he said, “will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.”
The president referred to a published study to claim that the climate pact would result in “as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025,” of which 440,000 would be in manufacturing.
By 2040, he said, the losses would balloon to 6.5 million industrial jobs, or $3 trillion in lost economic output, or about $7,000 in reduced income for the average household.
Critics dispute the methodology of that study, by the National Economic Research Associates.
They note that it was conducted for the American Council for Capital Formation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce — both vocal opponents of climate regulations.
Economists argue that the projected job losses in the study assume the American economy will not use innovation to adapt to the new regulations.
Apple, Mars, and Unilever are among companies that have said complying with the Paris agreement would open markets and generate jobs.
A raft of studies — from environmental organizations, Citibank, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — argue that a failure to mitigate the effects of climate change could cost the economy trillions of dollars.
“China and Europe have become world leaders on the path toward green development already,” said Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, “and will strengthen their position if the U.S. slips back at the national level.”
To dramatize the unfairness of the agreement, Mr. Trump asserted that it allows China, the world’s largest polluter, “to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.
They can do whatever they want for 13 years.”
Under China’s pledge, emissions would indeed continue to climb until 2030, and then begin declining.
But as its consumption of coal slows, China is on pace to beat that target.
Its government has pledged to generate 20 percent of its energy from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030, a formidable goal that will require the Chinese to install at least 800 gigawatts worth of solar, wind and nuclear energy capacity — a process that is already underway.
Mr. Trump noted that the pact would allow China and India to build more coal plants, while effectively shutting down development of a clean coal industry in the United States.
“The agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs,” the president said.
“It just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.”
Because the Paris accord is nonbinding, it has no direct effect on coal consumption in the United States.
The coal industry is in long-term decline because of cheaper alternatives, such as natural gas and renewable energies, along with stricter pollution standards imposed by the Obama administration.
Mr. Trump has moved to lift many of those restrictions, and he would be free to do so, even under the Paris agreement.
Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, acknowledged the declining role played by coal in the nation’s energy mix.
Speaking to reporters last week, he said, “Coal doesn’t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock.”
Mr. Trump tried to diminish the value of the accord by citing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, which said that if each nation lived up to its commitments, it would result in a reduction of only two-tenths of a degree Celsius in global temperatures by 2100.
“Tiny, tiny amount,” he said, holding his thumb and index finger together to drive home the point.
But that assertion does not accurately reflect the M.I.T. research.
The M.I.T. study in question looked at the difference between climate pledges made at previous talks and those made in the run-up to Paris, and it found that the Paris pledges would avoid an additional 0.2 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2100.
But the M.I.T. researchers also looked at the difference between all of the climate pledges made to date and a business-as-usual scenario in which countries failed to act.
In an updated 2016 analysis, they found that current climate pledges would result in global average temperatures rising between 2.7 and 3.6 degrees by the end of the century, compared with between 3.3 and 4.7 degrees if no action were taken, a difference of nearly a degree.
And the aim of the Paris agreement was to improve those pledges over time.
Mr. Trump saved particular vitriol for the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program under which richer countries transfer funds to poorer ones to help them mitigate the effects of climate change.
“Nice name,” he said, adding, “We’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.”
The United States has pledged $3 billion to the fund, which is the most of any country in aggregate terms.
But it is far from the only contributor, and on a per-capita basis, it is not the highest.
Sweden has contributed $581 million, which works out to a little less than $60 per person, six times the amount the United States is pledging per capita.
Even operating outside the Paris accord, Mr. Trump insisted that the United States would be an environmental exemplar.
“We’ll be the cleanest,” he promised.
“We’re going to have the cleanest air.
We’re going to have the cleanest water.”
That optimistic statement is contradicted by Yale University’s latest annual Environmental Performance Index.
The United States ranked 26th of 180 countries, according to the index, which assesses each nation’s water and air quality, biodiversity, agricultural outputs and climate change efforts.
It ranked 43rd in air quality, 22nd in water sanitation, and 44th in climate and energy policies.
Moreover, even after recent reductions, America’s carbon emissions per capita remain significantly higher than those of China or India — countries that Mr. Trump branded as the world’s big polluters.
President Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, weakening efforts to combat global warming and embracing isolationist voices in his White House who argued that the agreement was a pernicious threat to the economy and American sovereignty.In a speech from the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said the landmark 2015 pact imposed wildly unfair environmental standards on American businesses and workers.
He vowed to stand with the people of the United States against what he called a “draconian” international deal.
“I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president said, drawing support from members of his Republican Party but widespread condemnation from political leaders, business executives and environmentalists around the globe.
Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the agreement for environmental action signed by 195 nations is a remarkable rebuke to heads of state, climate activists, corporate executives and members of the president’s own staff, who all failed to change his mind with an intense, last-minute lobbying blitz.
The Paris agreement was intended to bind the world community into battling rising temperatures in concert, and the departure of the Earth’s second-largest polluter is a major blow.
Mr. Trump said he wanted to negotiate a better deal for the United States, and the administration said he had placed calls to the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Canada to personally explain his decision.
A statement from the White House press secretary said the president “reassured the leaders that America remains committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and to robust efforts to protect the environment.”
But within minutes of the president’s remarks, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement saying that the Paris climate accord was “irreversible” and could not be renegotiated.
The decision was a victory for Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, and Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who spent months quietly making their case to the president about the dangers of the agreement.
Inside the West Wing, the pair overcame intense opposition from other top aides, including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.
Ms. Trump, in particular, fought to make sure that her father heard from people supportive of the agreement, setting up calls and meetings with world leaders, corporate executives and others.
But by Thursday, aides who pushed to remain part of the agreement were disconsolate, and it was Mr. Pruitt whom the president brought up for victory remarks at the Rose Garden event.
The president’s speech was his boldest and most sweeping assertion of an “America first” foreign policy doctrine since he assumed office four months ago.
He vowed to turn the country’s empathy inward, rejecting financial assistance for pollution controls in developing nations in favor of providing help to American cities struggling to hire police officers.
“It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic affairs,” Mr. Trump said.
In Mr. Trump’s view, the Paris accord represents an attack on the sovereignty of the United States and a threat to the ability of his administration to reshape the nation’s environmental laws in ways that benefit everyday Americans.
“At what point does America get demeaned?
At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?”
Mr. Trump said.
“We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.
And they won’t be.”
But business leaders like Elon Musk of Tesla, Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs said the decision would ultimately harm the economy by ceding the jobs of the future in clean energy and technology to overseas competitors.
Mr. Musk, who had agreed to be a member of a two business-related councils that Mr. Trump set up this year, wrote on Twitter that he would leave those panels.
“Climate change is real.
Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” he said.
Under the accord, the United States had pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and commit up to $3 billion in aid for poorer countries by 2020.
By stepping away from the Paris agreement, the president made good on a campaign promise to “cancel” an agreement he repeatedly mocked at rallies.
As president, he has moved rapidly to reverse Obama-era policies aimed at allowing the United States to meet its pollution-reduction targets as set under the agreement.
“We are getting out,” Mr. Trump said Thursday.
“But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.
And if we can, that’s great.”
In his remarks, Mr. Trump listed sectors of the United States economy that would lose revenue and jobs if the country remained part of the accord, citing a study — vigorously disputed by environmental groups — asserting that the agreement would cost 2.7 million jobs by 2025.
But he will stick to the withdrawal process laid out in the Paris agreement, which President Barack Obama joined and most of the world has already ratified.
That could take nearly four years to complete, meaning a final decision would be up to the American voters in the next presidential election.
Republican lawmakers hailed Mr. Trump’s decision, calling it a necessary antidote to the overreach of Mr. Obama’s policies aimed at reducing planet-warming carbon emissions.
“I applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration’s assault on domestic energy production and jobs,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.
But Mr. Trump’s call for new global negotiations about the planet’s climate drew derision from Democrats in the United States and other heads of state.
President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada each issued rebukes to Mr. Trump.
“Make our planet great again,” Mr. Macron said.
On Twitter, Miguel Arias Cañete, the European Union’s commissioner for climate, said that “today’s announcement has galvanized us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership.”
Mr. Obama, in a rare assertion of his political views as a former president, said, “The nations that remain in the Paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.”
“Even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I’m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we’ve got,” Mr. Obama said.
In recent days, Mr. Trump withstood withering criticism from European counterparts who accused him of shirking America’s role as a global leader and America’s responsibility as history’s largest emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gasses.
After a fierce debate inside the administration, the White House on Thursday took on the trappings of a celebration.
The Rose Garden was packed with reporters, activists and members of Mr. Trump’s administration.
Scores of staff members lined the sides of the Rose Garden as a military band played soft jazz.
Supporters of the Paris agreements reacted with pent-up alarm, condemning the administration for shortsightedness about the planet and a reckless willingness to shatter longstanding diplomatic relationships.
“Removing the United States from the Paris agreement is a reckless and indefensible action,” said Al Gore, the former vice president who has become an evangelist for fighting climate change.
“It undermines America’s standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity’s ability to solve the climate crisis in time.”
Corporate leaders also condemned Mr. Trump’s action.
On its website, I.B.M. reaffirmed its support for the Paris agreement and took issue with the president’s contention that it was a bad deal for American workers and the American economy.
“This agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country,” the company said.
“I.B.M. believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it.”
Mr. Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, took to Twitter to say he was “disappointed” with the decision.
“Climate change is real,” he said.
“Industry must now lead and not depend on government.”
But Mr. Trump was resolute.
“It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; and Pittsburgh, Pa., along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France,” he said.
“It is time to make America great again.”
The mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, responded on Twitter, “I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future.”
Shifting from his previous blanket denials, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia suggested on Thursday that “patriotically minded” private Russian hackers could have been involved in cyberattacks last year that meddled in the United States presidential election.While
Mr. Putin continued to deny any state role in the hacking, his comments, made to reporters in St. Petersburg, Russia, departed from the Kremlin’s previous position: that Russia had played no role whatsoever in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and that, after Donald J. Trump’s victory, the United States had become the victim of anti-Russia hysteria among crestfallen Democrats.
Asked about suspicions that Russia might try to interfere in the coming elections in Germany, Mr. Putin raised the possibility of attacks on foreign votes by what he portrayed as free-spirited Russian patriots.
Hackers, he said, “are like artists” who choose their targets depending how they feel “when they wake up in the morning.”
Any such attacks, he added, could not alter the result of elections in Europe, America or elsewhere.
Artists, he said, paint if they wake up feeling in good spirits while hackers respond if “they wake up and read that something is going on in interstate relations” that prompts them to take action.
“If they are patriotically minded, they start making their contributions — which are right, from their point of view — to the fight against those who say bad things about Russia,” Mr. Putin added, apparently referring to Hillary Clinton.
The Kremlin took a dim view of Mrs. Clinton, considering her far less friendly toward Russia than a President Trump would be because of her blunt criticism of Mr. Putin and his policies in Syria and elsewhere.
Mr. Putin’s remarks stopped far short of accepting the conclusions of American intelligence agencies that the Kremlin was behind the election campaign cyberattacks.
But they opened room for verbal maneuvering by Moscow — and also by Mr. Trump — amid multiple investigations in the United States into Russian meddling, including one by the F.B.I. about the firing of its director, James B. Comey.
Perhaps worried that, as the investigations make headway, evidence will come to light that the Russian state or at least Russians were clearly involved in the hacking, Mr. Putin appeared to be setting up a pre-emptive line of defense, as the Kremlin did when it became difficult to simply deny initially secret Russian deployments to Ukraine in 2014, and to Syria in late 2015.
Swamped by evidence of Russian military involvement in Ukraine and then Syria, the Kremlin retreated from categorical denials to claims that Russians fighting in eastern Ukraine were Russian “vacationers” and that burly Russians who appeared in Syria were humanitarian aid workers.
It later acknowledged that the supposed aid workers were Russian soldiers.
The questions of Russian hacking, and interaction between Russian officials and members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have been a huge thorn in the side of the new administration.
The furor has led to the dismissal of Michael T. Flynn as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, forced his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to recuse himself from any Russia-tied election investigation and hampered the administration in fulfilling Mr. Trump’s agenda to “make America great again.”
Mr. Putin’s comments on Thursday about Russian hacking echoed those of Mr. Trump, who has dismissed accusations of Russian meddling in the election and said the person responsible for the attack on the Democratic National Committee “could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.”
Mr. Putin stuck firmly to earlier denials that Russian state bodies or employees had been involved, an accusation leveled by United States intelligence agencies.
They concluded in January that Mr. Putin himself had directed a Russian “influence campaign” involving cyberattacks and disinformation intended to tilt the November election in Mr. Trump’s favor.
“We’re not doing this on the state level,” Mr. Putin said on Thursday.
The boundary between state and private action, however, is often blurry in Russia, particularly in matters relating to the projection of Russian influence abroad.
This provides a measure of plausible deniability for actions that the Kremlin does not want to be linked to publicly.
Nominally private Russian citizens have fought alongside Russian-speaking rebels in eastern Ukraine and taken part in various campaigns to advance Moscow’s agenda in Eastern and Central Europe.
While much about Russia’s cyberwarfare program is shrouded in secrecy, there is growing evidence that it, too, has drawn on the skills and enthusiasm of nominally private individuals, including college students, who face mandatory military service, and even criminals.
In 2013, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, told university rectors at a meeting in Moscow that he was on a “head hunt in the positive meaning of the word” for coders.
The Obama administration signaled it was worried about Russia’s intermingling of state and private hacking when it struck back at Moscow over interference in the 2016 election.
In December, it expelled 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and included among sanctioned Russian companies a private firm set up by a young Russian woman  who called herself “mishacker.”
American intelligence agencies say a team of Russian hackers affiliated with Russia’s military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., stole emails and other data from the Democratic National Committee and then leaked the cache through WikiLeaks.
An expert at muddying the waters and creating confusion, Mr. Putin advanced a number of alternative theories that could help Moscow address any firm evidence that might emerge as a trail leading to Russia.
Stating that modern technology can easily be manipulated to create a false trail, he said, “I can imagine that someone is doing this purposefully — building the chain of attacks so that the territory of the Russian Federation appears to be the source of that attack.”
He added, “Modern technologies allow to do that kind of thing; it’s rather easy to do.”
Mr. Putin appeared to be repeating an argument he first made earlier in the week in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro.
“I think that he was totally right when he said it could have been someone sitting on their bed or somebody intentionally inserted a flash drive with the name of a Russian national, or something like that,” Mr. Putin told the French newspaper, referring to Mr. Trump.
“Anything is possible in this virtual world.
Russia never engages in activities of this kind, and we do not need it.
It makes no sense for us to do such things.
What for?”
The evolution of Russia’s position on possible meddling in the American election is similar to the way Mr. Putin repeatedly shifted his account of Russia’s role in the 2014 annexation of Crimea and in armed rebellions in eastern Ukraine.
He began by denying that Russian troops had taken part before acknowledging, months later, that the Russian military was “of course” involved.
Moscow has been disappointed by Mr. Trump’s failure so far to deliver on his election promises to “get along” with Russia.
But Mr. Putin told Le Figaro this week that he was “cautiously optimistic” that Mr. Trump would be able to break free of people he described as intent on blocking his path toward better relations with Moscow.
He is known as the Dark Prince or Ayatollah Mike, nicknames he earned as the Central Intelligence Agency officer who oversaw the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the American drone strike campaign that killed thousands of Islamist militants and hundreds of civilians.Now the official, Michael D’Andrea, has a new job.
He is running the C.I.A.’s Iran operations, according to current and former intelligence officials, an appointment that is the first major sign that the Trump administration is invoking the hard line the president took against Iran during his campaign.
Mr. D’Andrea’s new role is one of a number of moves inside the spy agency that signal a more muscular approach to covert operations under the leadership of Mike Pompeo, the conservative Republican and former congressman, the officials said.
The agency also recently named a new chief of counterterrorism, who has begun pushing for greater latitude to strike militants.
Iran has been one of the hardest targets for the C.I.A.
The agency has extremely limited access to the country — no American embassy is open to provide diplomatic cover — and Iran’s intelligence services have spent nearly four decades trying to counter American espionage and covert operations.
The challenge to start carrying out President Trump’s views falls to Mr. D’Andrea, a chain-smoking convert to Islam, who comes with an outsize reputation and the track record to back it up: Perhaps no single C.I.A. official is more responsible for weakening Al Qaeda.
“He can run a very aggressive program, but very smartly,” said Robert Eatinger, a former C.I.A. lawyer who was deeply involved in the agency’s drone program.
The C.I.A. declined to comment on Mr. D’Andrea’s role, saying it does not discuss the identities or work of clandestine officials.
The officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity because Mr. D’Andrea remains undercover, as do many senior officials based at the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va.
Mr. Eatinger did not use his name.
The New York Times is naming Mr. D’Andrea because his identity was previously published in news reports, and he is leading an important new administration initiative against Iran.
Mr. Trump called Iran “the number one terror state” and pledged throughout the campaign to dismantle or revise the landmark deal between Iran and six world powers in which Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
The president has not gone through with that threat, and his administration has quietly recertified Iran’s compliance with the deal.
But he has invoked his hard line on Iran in other ways.
Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has described the deal as a failure, and Mr. Trump has appointed to the National Security Council hawks eager to contain Iran and push regime change, the groundwork for which would most likely be laid through C.I.A. covert action.
Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, was an armored cavalry commander during the early years of the war in Iraq, and he believes that Iranian agents who were aiding Iraqi insurgents were responsible for the deaths of a number of his soldiers.
Derek Harvey, the senior director for the Middle East at the council, is also considered an Iran hawk.
And Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the council’s senior director for intelligence — the main White House liaison to intelligence agencies — has told other administration officials that he wants to use American spies to help oust the Iranian government, according to multiple defense and intelligence officials.
Mr. Pompeo, who represented south-central Kansas in the House, was among the fiercest congressional critics of the Iran deal.
Two months before the election, he published an essay in Foreign Policy magazine titled, “Friends Don’t Let Friends Do Business With Iran.”
He pledged during his Senate confirmation hearing in January that should the deal remain in place, he would keep a fierce watch to ensure Tehran was sticking to the terms.
“The Iranians are professionals at cheating,” he said.
In Mr. D’Andrea, the director has found a workaholic to be his Iran sentinel.
Mr. D’Andrea grew up in Northern Virginia in a family whose ties to the C.I.A. span two generations.
He met his wife, who is Muslim, on a C.I.A. posting overseas, and converted to Islam to marry her, though he is not known to be particularly observant.
At the C.I.A., Mr. D’Andrea’s reputation for operational acumen is matched by his abrasive demeanor.
“Surly” seems to be the most popular description, say those who have worked alongside him, and some people at the agency have refused to work for him.
A former agency official said that he had once asked Mr. D’Andrea, who has been known to keep a hideaway bed in his office, what he did for fun.
Mr. D’Andrea’s reply: “Work.”
Asked whether Mr. D’Andrea’s appointment was a sign that the C.I.A. planned to take up a more aggressive line toward Iran, Mr. Eatinger said, “I don’t think it’s the wrong read.”
Mr. D’Andrea’s personal views on Iran are not publicly known.
It is also not his job to make policy but to execute it, and he has demonstrated that he is an aggressive operations officer.
In the years after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. D’Andrea was deeply involved in the detention and interrogation program, which resulted in the torture of a number of prisoners and was condemned in a sweeping Senate report in 2014 as inhumane and ineffective.
Only the executive summary of the 6,700-page report has been made public; the Trump administration has begun returning copies of the full document to Congress, which is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, raising the prospect that it will never be released.
Mr. D’Andrea took over the agency’s Counterterrorism Center in early 2006 and spent the next nine years directing the hunt for militants around the world.
Operatives under his direction played a pivotal role in 2008 in the killing of Imad Mugniyah, the international operations chief for Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group based in Lebanon.
Working with the Israelis, the C.I.A. used a car bomb kill to Mr. Mugniyah as he walked home in Damascus, where Hezbollah enjoys strong ties with and support from the Syrian government.
At the same time, Mr. D’Andrea was ramping up the drone program inside Pakistan.
Drones became the preferred counterterrorism tool of President Barack Obama, who personally approved strikes targeting militant leaders.
When Mr. D’Andrea took over as the counterterrorism chief, only a handful of the agency’s drones were operational in Pakistan, and there were only three strikes that year, according to the Long War Journal, which keeps a tally of drone activity.
By 2010, when the drone campaign was at its height, the agency launched 117 strikes against Qaeda militants and other jihadists sheltering in the mountainous tribal areas that run along Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan.
The agency also expanded its drone program to Yemen under Mr. D’Andrea’s direction, and many in the C.I.A. credit him with playing an instrumental role in impairing Al Qaeda.
But there were also setbacks.
Mr. D’Andrea was at the helm when a C.I.A. source secretly working for Al Qaeda blew himself up at an American base in Afghanistan, killing seven agency operatives.
It was the single deadliest attack on C.I.A. personnel in more than a quarter-century.
And in January 2015, a drone struck a Qaeda compound in Pakistan where, unbeknown to the C.I.A., the militants were holding two hostages: Warren Weinstein, an American aid worker and economic adviser, and Giovanni Lo Porto, 37, an Italian.
Both men were killed in the strike.
A few months later, Mr. D’Andrea moved to a new post reviewing the effectiveness of covert action programs.
Former agency officials said Mr. D’Andrea’s new job overseeing Iran operations was better suited to his talents.
“A lot of people I know were scared of him and thought he was reckless, but he really wasn’t,” Mr. Eatinger said.
“He was very precise and held people to very high standards.”
Senators, spies and a president spent years in a pitched battle over how the history is told of one of the most controversial chapters of America’s campaign against terrorism, the detention and interrogation of prisoners in secret C.I.A. jails.But recent moves by the Trump administration have increased the likelihood that much of what is known about the macabre humiliations that unfolded in those jails around the world will remain hidden from public view.
Congressional officials said on Friday that the administration had begun returning to Congress copies of a 6,700-page Senate report from 2014 about the C.I.A. program.
The move raises the possibility that most of the copies could be locked in Senate vaults indefinitely or even destroyed — and increases the risk that future government officials, unable to read the report, will never learn its lessons.
The classified report is the result of a lengthy investigation into the program by Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, telling the story of how — in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks — the C.I.A. began capturing terrorism suspects and interrogating them in secret prisons beyond the reach of the American judicial and military legal systems.
The central conclusion of the report is that the spy agency’s interrogation methods — including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other kinds of torture — were far more brutal and less effective than the C.I.A. described to policy makers, Congress and the public.
The Trump administration’s decision honors the request of the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, who has portrayed the report as shoddy and excessively critical of the C.I.A. and the administration of President George W. Bush.
The F.B.I., the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the C.I.A. and the agency’s inspector general have returned their copies of the report, said American officials who asked not to be named to discuss the status of those classified copies.
The report is the most comprehensive accounting of the Bush-era program that exists.
A declassified executive summary was made public in December 2014, and it laid bare some of the worst excesses of the war on terrorism, drawing broad condemnation both inside the United States and abroad.
Officials who played important roles in the C.I.A. detention program remain at the agency, including its newly appointed deputy director, Gina Haspel, and the former head of the agency’s counterterrorism center, Michael D’Andrea.
Mr. D’Andrea recently assumed control of the agency’s Iran operations.
The Senate Intelligence Committee, which was run by Democrats when the executive summary was released, sent copies of the entire report to at least eight federal agencies, asking that they incorporate it into their records — a move that would have made the documents subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act.
That law, which allows citizens, the news media and other groups to request access to information held by the federal government, does not apply to congressional records.
The agencies all refused to add the report to their records, and instead kept their copies locked up, prompting the American Civil Liberties Union to sue the C.I.A. for access to the full report.
Some Republicans on the panel supported the publication of the 500-page executive summary.
Others issued a rebuttal that challenged some of the conclusions — but not specific facts — in the report, such as the finding that the interrogation methods did not produce useful intelligence.
After Republicans took over the Senate in early 2015, Mr. Burr asked the Obama administration to return all the copies that had been sent to the C.I.A., the Pentagon, the Justice Department and other executive-branch agencies.
The Obama administration instead left the matter to the courts, and the case was still being heard when President Trump took office on Jan. 20.
It was decided in April, with a ruling that cleared the way for the agencies to return their copies to the Senate.
Mr. Burr has called the report nothing more than a “footnote in history.”
His committee is now conducting one of the investigations into whether any of Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers or associates assisted in the Russian effort to disrupt last year’s presidential campaign.
The return of the report to the Senate committee “is extremely disturbing on a number of levels,” said Katherine Hawkins, senior counsel at the Constitution Project, an advocacy organization.
“First, it remains absurd that no one in the executive branch will open the full report.
Second, Senator Burr’s ongoing attempts to bury the torture report casts doubt on his willingness to follow the facts to conclusions that would damage the administration in the Russia probe.”
The C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.
The full report is not expected to offer evidence of previously undisclosed interrogation techniques, but the interrogation sessions are said to be described in great detail.
The report explains the origins of the program and identifies the officials involved, and also offers details on the role of each agency in the secret prison program.
It remains an open question what Mr. Burr will do with the copies that are returned to the Senate.
He said on Friday that the committee would “enact necessary measures to protect the sensitive sources and methods contained within the report.”
During his confirmation process to become director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he would read the full report.
Democrats on the committee expressed fear that the report would be buried — or worse, that electronic copies would be erased and hard copies destroyed.
“No senator — chairman or not — has the authority to erase history.
I believe that is the intent of the chairman in this case,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was the committee’s chairwoman when the report was written.
Some on the Democratic side also expressed frustration with what they considered the tepid response of the committee’s Democratic vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.
They said Mr. Warner felt it was more important to preserve his relationship with Mr. Burr for the sake of the Russia investigation than to battle over the detention report.
Mr. Warner said in a statement on Friday that the report was “a thorough, fact-based and straightforward history.”
He added, “This study must be preserved for history.”
At least three copies remain outside Senate hands, though they are off limits to the public.
In December, President Barack Obama notified the Senate that he was including a copy of the full report in his presidential records, which would be deposited at the National Archives and Records Administration.
That copy was still at the archives on Friday, said James B. Pritchett, a spokesman for the agency.
But presidential records are generally not eligible to be made public until 12 years after the president leaves office — and even then, classified documents, like the report, could remain secret indefinitely.
A second copy is in the hands of the Pentagon.
A judge overseeing the military commission prosecution of five Guantánamo Bay detainees accused of aiding the Sept. 11 attacks — each of whom was previously held by the C.I.A. — ordered the Defense Department in January to hold on to a copy.
And a third, which had been held by the Justice Department, is now at the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia.
Late in the Obama administration, two judges on that court ordered the administration to hand over a copy in response to requests by lawyers for two other former C.I.A. detainees who are now being held at the Guantánamo Bay prison.
The lawyers argued that preserving the report was necessary for their legal cases.
The Trump administration complied with the order in February, depositing the copy with the court’s security officer.
The Senate had also given the Justice Department a copy of the report for the F.B.I.
The bureau has returned that copy to the Senate, officials said.
The return of the F.B.I. copy could raise questions about whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions was abiding by a pledge he made during his confirmation process not to return the Justice Department’s copy to the Senate.
But a spokeswoman for Mr. Sessions, Sarah Isgur Flores, noted on Friday that the other copy once held by the Justice Department is with the Federal District Court, not the Senate.
As a businessman, President Trump was a frequent and scornful critic of the concept of climate change.
In the years before running for president, he called it “nonexistent,” “mythical” and a “a total con job.”
Whenever snow fell in New York, it seemed, he would mock the idea of global warming.“Global
warming has been proven to be a canard repeatedly over and over again,” he wrote on Twitter in 2012.
In another post later that year, he said, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”
A year later, he wrote that “global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!”
But on Friday, a day after Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate change accord, the White House refused to say whether the president still considers climate change a hoax.
As other leaders around the world vowed to confront climate change without the United States, Mr. Trump’s advisers fanned out to defend his decision and, when pressed, said they did not know his view of the science underlying the debate.
“I have not had an opportunity to have that discussion,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.
“I do not speak for the president,” said Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary.
“You should ask him that,” said Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor.
Mr. Trump offered no opportunity for anyone to ask him that on Friday.
But his current views, whatever they may be, presumably shaped his thinking as he evaluated whether to remain in the Paris accord.
Given that he promised on Thursday to seek to re-enter the pact on better terms or negotiate an entirely new deal that he said would be fairer to the United States, his acceptance or denial of climate science seems likely to determine his approach.
In his speech announcing his decision, he did not address the science of climate change or repeat any of the skepticism he has expressed for years.
Instead, he cast it largely in economic terms, arguing that President Barack Obama agreed to a bad deal for Americans that would handcuff the economy and put the United States at a disadvantage against its international competitors.
He did not say the goal itself was pointless, only that it would be too much of a burden.
But administration officials clearly saw no benefit in clarifying.
If they affirmed that he still believed climate change to be fake, they would expose him to even more criticism at home and abroad and complicate the lives of those advisers who accept the broad scientific consensus.
If they asserted that he had changed his mind and now agreed that climate change is real, then they would have to explain a flip-flop while risking criticism from his own base.
Moreover, recent weeks have reminded White House aides about the dangers of making declarative statements about the president’s beliefs or actions only to have him contradict them within days or even hours.
When Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, he sent out his vice president and top aides to give an explanation of his decision that quickly unraveled after he gave an interview with a conflicting version of events.
Climate science deniers, cheered by his decision to pull out of the Paris agreement, seemed willing to live without a clearer statement taking on what they call the bogus claims of environmental advocates.
“I think his withdrawing us from Paris was the greatest action by a president in my lifetime,” said Steve Milloy, who runs a website, JunkScience.com,
which aims to debunk climate change and who served on Mr. Trump’s environmental transition team.
“And he explained his action brilliantly.
Most substantive explanation I’ve ever heard from a president — including Reagan.”
“What he believes,” Mr. Milloy added, “you need to get from him.”
Supporters of the Paris accord said the White House refusal to outline Mr. Trump’s beliefs on climate change indicated that he had not bothered to inform himself on the issue before making a decision with enormous consequences.
“By not admitting what his views on this, the White House is just hiding the fact that Trump is too incurious to actually look seriously at the issue,” said Andrew Light, a former Obama State Department official who helped negotiate the Paris pact.
Carol Browner, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator under Bill Clinton and adviser to Mr. Obama, said Mr. Trump’s action seemed founded on misinformation.
“Seems he accepts junk science in his decision making which makes you wonder if next he will repeal bans on indoor smoking and put lead back in paint,” she said.
Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the E.P.A. and a longtime critic of what he calls “climate exaggerators,” said the question of what Mr. Trump believed about the science never came up during the administration’s deliberations over the Paris agreement.
“What’s interesting about all the discussions that we had through the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue: Is Paris good or not for this country?” he told reporters at the White House.
“That’s the discussions I’ve had with the president.”
Mr. Pruitt and other administration officials defended Mr. Trump’s decision as a courageous action to protect the United States.
“We have nothing to be apologetic about as a country,” he said, noting that the country has reduced its carbon emissions in recent years, attributing that to innovation and technology rather than government regulation.
“So, when we look at issues like this, we are leading with action and not words,” he said.
“I also want to say that exiting Paris does not mean disengagement.”
Describing his own views, Mr. Pruitt derided those “climate exaggerators,” who he said make assertions with great certainty.
Mr. Pruitt said he has concluded that “global warming is occurring, that human activity contributes to it in some manner” but “measuring with precision, from my perspective, the degree of human contribution is very challenging.”
Mr. Trump has not been so shy in the past about his opinions on the subject.
At one point in 2009, he signed an open letter to Mr. Obama published as an ad in newspapers supporting “meaningful and effective measures to control climate change,” although that may have just reflected the influence of the three adult children who also signed.
But he soon found climate change to be a favorite target on Twitter, mentioning the topic scores of times over the years, particularly during cold weather spells.
“Any and all weather events are used by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our planet!” he wrote in 2014.
“They don’t believe it $$$$!”
As he opened his presidential campaign, he told Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host, that the weather changed naturally over time and that there was not a major problem.
“I’m not a believer in global warming,” he said.
“I’m not a believer in man-made global warming.”
After he won the election last November, he tempered his views in an interview with The New York Times, saying that he believed “there is some connectivity” between human activity and climate change and promising to look at the issue with fresh eyes.
“I have a very open mind,” he said.
“And I’m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we’re going to look at it very carefully.
But I have an open mind.”
By this week, however, Mr. Trump was no longer speaking his mind on the question of the science, and neither were his aides.
Mr. Spicer said twice this week that he had not had the chance to ask the president.
Asked if he would find time to take the question to Mr. Trump, he said, “If I can, I will.”
Just a few years ago, the world watched nervously as India went on a building spree of coal-fired power plants, more than doubling its capacity and claiming that more were needed.
Coal output, officials said, would almost triple, to 1.5 billion tons, by 2020.India’s plans were cited by American critics of the Paris climate accord as proof of the futility of advanced nations trying to limit their carbon output.
But now, even as President Trump pulls the United States out of the pact, India has undergone an astonishing turnaround, driven in great part by a steep fall in the cost of solar power.
Experts now say that India not only has no need of any new coal-fired plants for at least a decade, given that existing plants are running below 60 percent of capacity, but that after that it could rely on renewable sources for all its additional power needs.
Rather than building coal-fired plants, it is now canceling many in the early planning stages.
And last month, the government lowered its annual production target for coal to 600 million tons from 660 million.
The sharp reversal, welcome news to world leaders trying to avert the potentially deadly effects of global warming, is a reflection both of the changing economics of renewable energy and a growing environmental consciousness in a country with some of the worst air pollution in the world.
What India does matters, because it is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China and the United States.
And its energy needs are staggering — nearly one-quarter of its population has no electricity and many others get it only intermittently.
With India’s power needs expected to grow substantially as its economy continues to expand, its energy use will heavily influence the world’s chances of containing the greenhouse gases that scientists believe are driving global warming.
Much attention at the time of the signing of the Paris agreement was focused on the role President Barack Obama played in pushing India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to sign.
In doing so, Mr. Modi committed India to achieving 40 percent of its electricity capacity from nonfossil-fuel sources by 2030.
Less understood was Mr. Modi’s longstanding personal commitment to taking India in a greener direction.
That has been strengthened in recent years by growing evidence that a greener path makes political and economic sense as well, says Harsh Pant, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based research organization.
“Modi’s constituency is the middle class, and the middle class in Indian cities is choking on pollution,” Mr. Pant said.
“Modi knows climate change is good politics.
Climate change makes sense to Modi because he believes it as it is good economics and politics.”
Two major economic factors lie at the heart of India’s move away from coal.
The first is that the country’s growth rate, while faster than that of most major economies, slipped to 6.1 percent for the most recent quarter, down from 7 percent in the previous quarter.
And much of that growth has come in service industries rather than in power-hungry manufacturing.
Equally important is the startling drop in the price of renewable energy sources.
Many energy experts say renewables are poised to become a less expensive alternative to coal within the next decade.
“The train has left the station.
Mr. Trump has come too late” to slow the transition to renewable energy, said Ajay Mathur, director general of the Energy Resources Institute, a New Delhi policy center closely associated with the government.
“By the time the coal-fired plants come up to full capacity because of increasing demand, the price of renewables will be lower than the price of coal.”
Based on December data from the Central Electric Authority, Mr. Mathur’s institute reported in March that India might be able to meet its additional power needs in the future with renewable energy.
It based that prediction on the remarkable drop in the cost of solar power.
In approving proposals for new solar power plants, the Indian government seeks bids from prospective builders who compete to pledge the lowest price at which they anticipate selling power.
Five years ago, the lowest bid came in at 7 rupees, or 11 cents, per kilowatt-hour.
In early May, the lowest bidder came in at less than half of that price, or 2.44 rupees per kilowatt-hour, a little under 4 cents, experts here say.
The latest bid makes solar power less expensive than coal, which sells for about 3 rupees per kilowatt-hour.
Storage costs, a critical component of renewable energy systems, have also fallen.
“The crucial question has been, ‘Yes, but what do you do when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine?’” said Adair Turner, the chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission, which studies climate issues.
The cost of lithium ion batteries, the gold standard in solar power storage, has fallen significantly, Mr. Turner said, largely because of economies of scale.
Where the price was about $1,000 per kilowatt-hour more than five years ago, it is now $273 and dropping, Mr. Mathur said.
The price needs to fall to $100 per kilowatt-hour for renewable energy to be comparable in price to coal, Mr. Mathur says.
Mr. Turner thinks that will happen far sooner than the year 2030, which his group had been predicting.
“To be blunt, the success of this has been bigger than I certainly realized,” Mr. Turner said.
“There were people who were optimists, and it’s the optimists who have won out.”
New Delhi had long argued that it was hypocritical of Western nations that have burned fossil fuels for centuries to ask Indians to sacrifice their growth to cope with the effects.
But the Modi administration has set ambitious targets for a greener Indian future.
The government pledged in 2015, when the country’s electricity capacity from renewables was 36 gigawatts, to increase it to 175 gigawatts by 2022.
Piyush Goyal, India’s power minister, announced in a speech in late April that the country would take steps to assure that by 2030 only electric cars would be sold.
“That’s rather ambitious,” Rahul Tongia, a fellow at Brookings India, said.
“The targets are there.
The vision is there.
The question is: ‘Is it going to happen?
How?’”
The Indian government’s policy research arm, the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog, recently released a report in collaboration with the Rocky Mountain Institute in Boulder, Colo., that calculated India could save $60 billion and reduce its projected carbon emissions by 37 percent by 2030 if it adopted widespread use of electric vehicles and more public transportation.
Mr. Mathur says that even if India falls short of those ambitious goals, just coming close will have a huge impact on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the world and pollution within the country.
“Even a year and a half ago, I didn’t expect we would go out on a limb and say electric vehicles are a public policy goal for us.
It is truly exciting,” he said in an interview.
Besides reducing the choking pollution in India’s cities, moving to electric vehicles also makes sense because the country has excess generation capacity in the underused coal-fired plants and is too heavily reliant on petroleum imports, which present a geopolitical risk.
“There has for a very long time been a push to reduce the growth in imports,” Mr. Mathur said.
“This is one of those perfect policy opportunities, with short-term and long-term benefits.”
Navroz Dubash, a fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, cautions that even though India is likely to meet its additional energy needs in the future from renewable sources, that does not mean India is about to stop burning coal tomorrow.
“It is important not to draw from this that India’s tryst with coal is necessarily done,” Mr. Dubash said, “just that there are signs it will end sooner and at a lower level than expected.”
India canceled 13.7 gigawatts of proposed coal-fired power plants last month alone, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said.
The government has admitted that an additional 8.6 gigawatts of coal-fired generation capacity built at a cost of $9 billion is potentially no longer financially viable because of competition from renewable sources, the institute said.
This is hopeful news for the world, said Mr. Tongia, because the only way for the world not to grow too warm is for “developing countries, especially India, to do more, to come in lower than budget, to do their unfair share.”
And, Mr. Tongia said, “the good news” is that India has decided that it is in its interest to do its “unfair share.”
As news that President Trump was pulling out of the Paris climate accord hit at a luncheon for small-business owners in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday, an already happy crowd suddenly turned euphoric.“It
was like a major win at a football game,” said Rick Longenecker, a management consultant who had been among the 50 or so attendees who gathered to trade thoughts amid a rapidly improving local economy.
While multinational corporations such as Disney, Goldman Sachs and IBM have opposed the president’s decision to walk away from the international climate agreement, many small companies around the country were cheering him on, embracing the choice as a tough-minded business move that made good on Mr. Trump’s commitment to put America’s commercial interests first.
This full-throated support from the small-business community comes even as the Trump administration struggles to advance health care legislation and tax reform plans through Congress — and despite the swelling controversy over Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia.
In Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and beyond, many small businesses are reporting improved sales and bigger work forces — regardless of what is going on in Washington.
“We’ve had customers who actually brought business back from Mexico that we haven’t done in seven years,” said Bill Polacek, president of JWF Industries, a manufacturer in Johnstown, Pa.
While local business leaders, some who were previously interviewed, acknowledged that little has been done by the administration so far in terms of turning promises into law, especially with regard to health care and taxes, most were not yet ready to blame the president.
“There is a new sheriff in town,” said Louis M. Soltis, the owner of a company in Toledo that manufactures control panels for large factories.
“But the biggest frustration that I have is that there is so much resistance that is keeping him from moving forward.”
In the months following Mr. Trump’s election victory, as stock markets hit historical highs and companies kept adding jobs, the business community as a whole seemed willing to give the president a chance to follow through on his bold promises to revitalize the economy by cutting taxes and rolling back regulations.
But the move to pull the United States out of an agreement it had previously signed with 195 countries has opened up a fissure between smaller companies and some of the biggest names in business.
In the hours after the president’s announcement, dozens of companies including General Electric, Facebook and Microsoft voiced their opposition to the decision, and two prominent chief executives resigned from the president’s business advisory council.
Many small-business leaders in the Midwest, on the other hand, were largely unfazed.
For those more concerned with their local economies than global greenhouse gas emissions, walking away from the Paris agreement was just another example of a bottom-line business decision made by a president who knows a good deal from a bad one.
“This just heightens the divide between big business and small business,” said Jeffrey Korzenik, an investment strategist for Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati who spends much of his time talking to small businesses in the Midwest.
“They really have different worldviews.”
At the root of this disconnect is a sense that companies that employ up to a few hundred workers — such companies make up 99 percent of businesses in the United States and account for half of its private sector employment — are held to a more onerous standard than their larger peers when it comes to complying with regulations.
At the Toledo luncheon, for example, much of the discussion centered on the fact that the climate treaty is nonbinding.
To businessmen who have spent the past 10 years complaining of ceaseless rules and regulations, the very idea that the climate pact lacked teeth was galling.
“When companies here do business with a Ford or a G.M., they sign a contract that is not only binding — in many cases it is pretty harsh,” Mr. Longenecker said.
“Now we have this deal to prevent a global catastrophe, and it’s nonbinding?
That is ridiculous.
And it makes us think that there is a hidden agenda, that we are just transferring trillions of dollars to China.”
To some small business executives, seeing the president talk tough to the Europeans and the Chinese was a reminder of why they voted for him in the first place.
“I think that we’re making a very big deal over a molehill,” said Dave Griggs, owner of Dave Griggs Flooring America in Columbia, Mo. which employs 16 people.
“I think the president is exactly right, we need to certainly renegotiate.”
But local business leaders are not without their worries.
Mr. Griggs said that he was concerned about health care, particularly since Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City announced last month that it would pull out of the insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act, potentially affecting many Missouri residents.
However, he said he still believed the administration would come through on its promise to replace the Affordable Care Act with something better.
“We’ve got a Republican Congress, a Republican president; hopefully we can get some initiatives passed,” Mr. Griggs said.
“I am highly optimistic.”
But by and large, local business leaders said they remained supportive of the president and believed the attention on his campaign’s ties to Russia was overblown.
John Bagge, 64, who runs a catering company in Kirkland, Wash., with his wife and two daughters, said his business was booming — so much so that this was the first summer he has had to turn away customers in 40 years.
“Until we have the evidence, let’s just keep busy making America a better country, growing the economy and putting people back to work, rather than spending so much time arguing back and forth about who’s guilty and who’s not,” he said.
The chief executives of big American companies were less sanguine, and many distanced themselves from Mr. Trump.
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, both resigned from the president’s economic advisory council on Thursday.
“Climate change is real,” Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter.
“Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.”
Other big company executives — including the chief executives Douglas McMillon of Walmart and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM — voiced their opposition to the president’s decision but said they would remain on the council.
“Disappointed in today’s news about the Paris Agreement,” Mr. McMillon said in a Facebook post on Thursday.
“We think it’s important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
Despite remaining broadly supportive of the president, some businessmen said that the whirlwind of controversies was beginning to raise questions about just how effective this administration could be.
Jim Stouffer, Jr. the president of Catawba Island Club, a local resort in Port Clinton, Ohio, said he supported the decision to leave the Paris agreement, but added that he was growing more uncertain of what the future holds.
“I don’t know what his endgame is,” he said.
Kyle Chapman expected he might find a fight.
And he didwith a teenage girl.The girl was waving an anti-fascist placard last week at a protest against Shariah law in Midtown Manhattan when a scuffle broke out and she knocked an older woman to the ground.
“Assaulting our people?”
Mr. Chapman shouted as he reached across the barricades and ripped her sign apart.
“Your days are numbered, Commie!” he called after her as the police escorted her away.
“The American people are rising up against you!”
As the founder of a group of right-wing vigilantes called the Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights, Mr. Chapman, a 6-foot-2, 240-pound commercial diver, is part of a growing movement that experts on political extremism say has injected a new element of violence into street demonstrations across the country.
Part fight club, part Western-pride fraternity, the Alt-Knights and similar groups recruit battalions of mainly young white men for one-off confrontations with their ideological enemies — the black-clad left-wing militants who disrupted President Trump’s inauguration and have protested against the appearances of conservative speakers on college campuses.
Along with like-minded groups like the Proud Boys, a clan of young conservative nationalists, and the Oath Keepers, an organization of current and former law-enforcement officers and military veterans, they mobilized on social media to fight in New Orleans over the removal of Confederate monuments; on the streets of Berkeley, Calif., where clashes between the left and right have increasingly become a threat for law enforcement; and at a raucous May Day rally in Los Angeles.
Both sides have issued a call to arms this weekend for an event being billed as a “Trump Free Speech Rally” in Portland, Ore., which is already on edge after a man was charged in the murder of two people who tried to intercede last week as he hurled anti-Islamic insults at two women on a train.
“This is a war,” declared the Proud Boys’ founder, Gavin McInnes, in a column this week.
Law enforcement has taken notice.
At the protest last week at the City University of New York, which had been heavily promoted on social media, throngs of police officers lined the sidewalk before it began.
In Portland, the police said they were mobilizing a robust presence because of what they have seen online.
“It’s almost like a street fight, like a rumble, the way it’s being advertised,” said Sgt. Pete Simpson, a spokesman.
Many in the movement, like Mr. Chapman and Mr. McInnes, say they are supporters of Mr. Trump’s agenda to tighten immigration and fight political correctness.
While Mr. Trump has recently taken steps to denounce hate speech and violence, the proliferation of militant groups on both the left and the right is part of the new reality of political expression.
Advocates who track extremism say the president, who egged on violent supporters during his campaign, has played a role in emboldening the groups.
To Mr. Chapman, 41, who on social media goes by the nom de guerre Based Stickman — “based” is slang for not caring what others think, and “stickman” refers to the closet dowel he wielded this spring at his first political skirmish — the Alt-Knights are a frustrated brotherhood of right-leaning soldiers conscripted to do battle with the left and devoted, as he put it in a Facebook post in April, to “defense and confrontation.”
“There’s been a lot of organized violence on the part of the left against the right, so we have to organize,” Mr. Chapman said.
“The purpose is to have a peaceful event.
But if people are attacked, you have to be ready and willing to defend yourself and your right-wing brothers and sisters.”
This form of aggression is something researchers say they have not seen on such a scale before on the far right, where the chosen method of provocation for groups like neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan is to demand the use of public space for rallies where they can spew racist and offensive language that is nonetheless protected as free speech.
“These are new people to us,” said Heidi Beirich, the Intelligence Project director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist movements.
Typically, the far-right groups they study will demonstrate but avoid confrontation, acting in a “defensive crouch,” she added.
“But saying, ‘We’re going to show up and we’re intending to get in fights,’ that’s a new thing,” Ms. Beirich said.
Some groups like the Proud Boys have initiation rituals that include violent hazing and require an oath of fealty to Western culture.
Their followers thrive on hyper-masculinity and celebrate when one of their brethren hits a leftist agitator.
They mock Islam and purport to be soldiers against a “war on Whites,” while being mindful not to embrace overt white supremacy.
Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime associate of Mr. Trump’s, has taken the Proud Boy oath.
The Alt-Knights were initially conceived as a paramilitary wing of the Proud Boys, designed to provide protection for audiences listening to conservative speakers like Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos, whose public events have been canceled because of threats of violence.
The groups openly post on Facebook and Twitter to spout Islamophobic and anti-immigrant speech, recruit new members and mobilize followers to go to demonstrations where violence might erupt, taking advantage of the porous standards that social media companies set for offensive and violent speech.
The internet commerce businesses PayPal and GoFundMe recently blocked Mr. Chapman from accepting money from supporters.
He also said he has been barred twice from Facebook, though only temporarily.
But his Facebook account, which has about 33,000 followers, remains a source of Islamophobic posts and calls for others to join him at events where clashes are likely.
The founder of the Proud Boys, Mr. McInnes, 46, a Canadian with a hipster-lumberjack aesthetic, is no stranger to controversy.
He helped found Vice Media and edited its edgy magazine before leaving in 2007 over differences with his partners.
In one episode that drew his colleagues’ ire, he told The New York Times in 2003, “I love being white.”
Mr. McInnes has seemed to find sophomoric pleasure in offending liberals, feminists, “beta male culture” and transgender people.
His work is often inflected with a tone of crass, satirical bigotry that leaves him just enough room to declare it all a joke.
While Mr. McInnes insists that the Proud Boys are “are a normal fraternal organization like the Shriners,” the sentiments that unify its members are often tinged with disrespect for nonwhite culture.
Of white men, he once wrote: “We brought roads and infrastructure to India and they are still using them as toilets.
Our criminals built nice roads in Australia but aboriginals keep using them as a bed.”
In Berkeley in April, Mr. McInnes and a gang of Proud Boys gathered after Ms. Coulter, the conservative commentator, pulled out of an appearance over security concerns.
Things quickly turned boozy and bizarre.
After a few remarks, Mr. McInnes initiated a new group of Proud Boys, some wearing “Make America Great Again” hats.
The first ritual, as captured on video and explained by a member, was to “announce yourself as a white, proud Western chauvinist, make sure everyone knows it, and don’t be ashamed.”
In a second ritual, the recruits were punched repeatedly until they recited the names of five breakfast cereals.
The use of ironic, juvenile antics is something commonly seen on the fringes of the right because it allows a veneer of deniability, experts said.
“It gives them an out, a gray area where they can make this safe space to say what they want,” said Carla Hill, a researcher for the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism.
Mr. Chapman described himself as a student of history, a lover of combat and a right-wing warrior bent on ridding the United States of “neo-Marxists” and “Communist domestic terrorist organizations.”
Though he now lives in the Bay Area, he was raised in San Diego and Houston, where, court records say, he had a taste for huffing Scotchgard fabric spray.
As a youth, he said, he often tussled with Latino gangs and claimed to have been shot and stabbed twice before he graduated from high school.
“It was a very violent environment,” Mr. Chapman said.
“You’d go down to the boardwalk, you’d drink and get in a fight, and that would be a great Friday or Saturday night.”
Mr. Chapman voted last year for Mr. Trump and now refers to himself as an “American nationalist.”
During the campaign, he watched from the sidelines as scuffles erupted at Mr. Trump’s events, but could not take part because at that point, he was on parole from a federal weapons charge — one of his three felony arrests.
Then, in February, he saw the footage on television of Kiara Robles, a young Trump supporter, getting pepper-sprayed by an anti-fascist activist.
“I said to myself, ‘You know what?’” he recalled.
“‘That’s it.
I’m done.’”
By then he was off parole, and on March 4, he attended a Trump rally in a public park in Berkeley, carrying his closet dowel and clad in ersatz armor: a baseball helmet, a gas mask, ski goggles, shin pads, a wooden shield.
When Mr. Chapman clubbed a demonstrator over the head, he earned his nickname and became a hero to the “I’m mad as hell” right after his arrest.
That was when he became acquainted with Mr. McInnes, who reached out to tell him that a Proud Boy in Berkeley had created a fund to pay his bail.
“He’s a great guy,” Mr. McInnes said.
“I wanted to make him president of the Proud Boys, but it makes more sense that he runs the Alt-Knights.”
Aside from his encounter with the teenage girl, Mr. Chapman remained fight-free last week at the Shariah law protest.
He mostly roamed the crowd, snapping selfies with his fans, followed by a flock of acolytes, some of whom, in homage to him, were dressed in pads and helmets, and carried heavy sticks.
Later that day, Mr. McInnes gave a party in an unmarked bar on Lexington Avenue.
There were Alt-Knights, Proud Boys, bikers in leather vests and young guys with the American flag around their necks.
Though the crowd was mostly white men, there were women, a few black people and Latinos.
After three or four hours, a rowdy mood set in. “I have a question!”
Mr. Chapman shouted at one point, commanding the attention of the room.
“What do we stand for?” “Freedom!”
people yelled.
“And what do we bleed for?”
Mr. Chapman shouted.
“Freedom!”
they yelled again.
He suddenly grabbed the man beside him.
“Are you ready to bleed?”
Mr. Chapman shouted at the man.
“I’m ready to bleed!” he yelled.
On the eve of the Arab-Israeli war, 50 years ago this week, Israeli officials raced to assemble an atomic device and developed a plan to detonate it atop a mountain in the Sinai Peninsula as a warning to Egyptian and other Arab forces, according to an interview with a key organizer of the effort that will be published Monday.The secret contingency plan, called a “doomsday operation” by Itzhak Yaakov, the retired brigadier general who described it in the interview, would have been invoked if Israel feared it was going to lose the 1967 conflict.
The demonstration blast, Israeli officials believed, would intimidate Egypt and surrounding Arab states — Syria, Iraq and Jordan — into backing off.
Israel won the war so quickly that the atomic device was never moved to Sinai.
But Mr. Yaakov’s account, which sheds new light on a clash that shaped the contours of the modern Middle East conflict, reveals Israel’s early consideration of how it might use its nuclear arsenal to preserve itself.
“It’s the last secret of the 1967 war,” said Avner Cohen, a leading scholar of Israel’s nuclear history who conducted many interviews with the retired general.
Mr. Yaakov, who oversaw weapons development for the Israeli military, detailed the plan to Dr. Cohen in 1999 and 2000, years before he died in 2013 at age 87.
“Look, it was so natural,” said Mr. Yaakov, according to a transcription of a taped interview.
“You’ve got an enemy, and he says he’s going to throw you to the sea.
You believe him.”
“How can you stop him?” he asked.
“You scare him.
If you’ve got something you can scare him with, you scare him.”
Israel has never acknowledged the existence of its nuclear arsenal, in an effort to preserve “nuclear ambiguity” and forestall periodic calls for a nuclear-free Middle East.
In 2001, Mr. Yaakov was arrested, at age 75, on charges that he had imperiled the country’s security by talking about the nuclear program to an Israeli reporter, Ronen Bergman, whose work was censored.
At various moments, American officials, including former President Jimmy Carter long after he left office, have acknowledged the existence of the Israeli program, though they have never given details.
A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington said the Israeli government would not comment on Mr. Yaakov’s role.
If the Israeli leadership had detonated the atomic device, it would have been the first nuclear explosion used for military purposes since the United States’ attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 22 years earlier.
The plan had a precedent: The United States considered the same thing during the Manhattan Project, as the program’s scientists hotly debated whether to set off a blast near Japan in an effort to scare Emperor Hirohito into a quick surrender.
The military vetoed the idea, convinced that it would not be enough to end the war.
According to Mr. Yaakov, the Israeli plan was code-named Shimshon, or Samson, after the biblical hero of immense strength.
Israel’s nuclear deterrence strategy has long been called the “Samson option” because Samson brought down the roof of a Philistine temple, killing his enemies and himself.
Mr. Yaakov said he feared that if Israel, as a last resort, went ahead with the demonstration nuclear blast in Egyptian territory, it could have killed him and his commando team.
Dr. Cohen, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California and the author of “Israel and the Bomb” and “The Worst-Kept Secret,” described the idea behind the atomic demonstration as giving “the prime minister an ultimate option if everything else failed.”
Dr. Cohen, who was born in Israel and educated in part in the United States, has pushed the frontiers of public discourse on a fiercely hidden subject: how Israel became an unacknowledged nuclear power in the 1960s.
On Monday, the Nuclear Proliferation International History Project of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington — where Dr. Cohen is a global fellow — is releasing on a special website a series of documents related to the atomic plan.
The project maintains a digital archive of his work known as the Avner Cohen Collection.
(President Trump’s proposed budget calls for the elimination of all federal funding for the center, which Congress created as a living memorial to Wilson.)
It has long been known that Israel, fearful for its existence, rushed to complete its first atomic device on the eve of the Arab-Israeli war.
But the planned demonstration remained secret in a country where it is taboo to discuss even half-century-old nuclear plans, and where fears persist that Iran will eventually obtain a nuclear weapon, despite its deal with world powers.
Shimon Peres, the former Israeli president and prime minister who died last year, hinted at the plan’s existence in his memoirs.
He referred to an unnamed proposal that “would have deterred the Arabs and prevented the war.”
At the time of the 1967 war, the world’s main nuclear powers were observing an accord known as the Partial Test Ban Treaty.
To curb radiation hazards, it prohibited all test detonations of nuclear arms except for those conducted underground.
That Israel considered an open explosion was a measure of its desperation.
“The goal,” Mr. Yaakov says on the transcribed tape, “was to create a new situation on the ground, a situation which would force the great powers to intervene, or a situation which would force the Egyptians to stop and say, ‘Wait a minute, we didn’t prepare for that.’
The objective was to change the picture.”
Dr. Cohen said he struck up a relationship with Mr. Yaakov after he published “Israel and the Bomb” in 1998.
He interviewed him for hours in the summer and fall of 1999 and in early 2000, always in Hebrew and mainly in Midtown Manhattan, where the former general lived.
Those interviews paint a picture of Israel’s recognition in the early 1960s that it needed a crash program to get the bomb.
In 1963, Mr. Yaakov, a freshly minted colonel with engineering degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and from Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology, became the senior liaison officer between the Israel Defense Forces and the country’s civilian defense units, including the project to make an atom bomb.
As Mr. Yaakov recounted the story, in May 1967, as tensions rose with Egypt over its decision to close the Straits of Tiran between the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea, he was half a world away, visiting the RAND Corporation in California.
He was suddenly summoned back to Israel.
With it clear that war was imminent, Mr. Yaakov said, he initiated, drafted and promoted a plan aimed at detonating a nuclear device in the sparsely populated Eastern Sinai Desert in a display of force.
The site chosen for the proposed explosion was a mountaintop about 12 miles from an Egyptian military complex at Abu Ageila, a critical crossroads where, on June 5, Ariel Sharon commanded Israeli troops in a battle against the Egyptians.
(Mr. Sharon later became prime minister, and died in 2014.)
The plan, if activated by order of the prime minister and military chief of staff, was to send a small paratrooper force to divert the Egyptian Army in the desert area so that a team could lay preparations for the atomic blast.
Two large helicopters were to land, deliver the nuclear device and then create a command post in a mountain creek or canyon.
If the order came to detonate, the blinding flash and mushroom cloud would have been seen throughout the Sinai and Negev Deserts, and perhaps as far away as Cairo.
It is impossible to know what the extent of any casualties might have been.
That would have depended on such unknowns as the size of the weapon, the population density of the region and the direction of the wind on the day of the detonation.
Mr. Yaakov described a helicopter reconnaissance flight he made with Israel Dostrovsky, the first director general of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, the civilian arm of the bomb program.
The helicopter had to turn back after the pilots learned that Egyptian jets were taking off, perhaps to intercept them.
“We got very close,” Mr. Yaakov recalled.
“We saw the mountain, and we saw that there is a place to hide there, in some canyon.”
On the eve of the war, Mr. Yaakov said, he was filled with the same doubts that had gnawed at the American scientists during the Manhattan Project.
Would the bomb explode?
Would he survive the blast?
He never got to find out.
Israel defeated three Arab armies, gained territory four times its original size and became the region’s foremost military power using conventional arms.
Nonetheless, Mr. Yaakov continued to lobby for an atomic demonstration to make clear the country’s new status as a nuclear power.
But the idea went nowhere.
“I still think to this day that we should have done it,” he told Dr. Cohen.
During a visit to Israel, a year after telling his story to Dr. Cohen in New York, where he had worked as a venture capitalist after having played a key role in the founding of Israel’s technology industry, Mr. Yaakov was arrested on charges of “high espionage” that carried a maximum penalty of life behind bars.
The exact charges were a mystery, and he was put on a secret trial.
“We see this as a very sad story of a person who dedicates his life to the security of Israel and ends up caught in a huge story that gets blown out of proportion and jeopardizes his reputation, his career, his legacy, everything,” Jack Chen, one of his lawyers, told The New York Times at the time.
It turned out that the charges centered on his conversations with the Israeli reporter, whose account of the 1967 plan was censored by the military.
Mr. Yaakov was found guilty of handing over secret information without authorization, the lesser of the charges against him.
He was given a two-year suspended sentence.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, in its obituary of Mr. Yaakov, said he had never fully recovered from his legal ordeal and, during his final days, bitterly discussed its details with fellow retired officers.
Dr. Cohen said he and Mr. Yaakov continued to get together long after the interviews and the secret trial — for instance, in a restaurant in Tel Aviv around 2009.
He said he had promised Mr. Yaakov he would find the right time and the right place to make his story public.
Now, he said, on the 50th anniversary of the war — with Mr. Yaakov and so many other witnesses long dead — it seemed like the right time.
A new president confronts an old war, one that bedeviled his predecessor.
He is caught between seasoned military commanders, who tell him that the road to victory is to pour in more American troops, and skeptical political advisers, who argue that a major deployment is a futile exercise that will leave him politically vulnerable.Barack Obama in 2009.
But also Donald J. Trump in 2017.
As Mr. Trump faces his most consequential decision yet as commander in chief — whether to send thousands more troops to Afghanistan, where a truck bombing on Wednesday offered a brutal reminder that the 16-year-old war is far from over — his administration is divided along familiar fault lines.
The dispute pits two generals who had formative experiences in Afghanistan — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster — against political aides, led by the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who fear that sending in more troops would be a slippery slope toward nation-building.
“They are going to be faced with the same questions we were,” said David Axelrod, a former senior Obama adviser, who worried, during the 2009 debate, that the generals were boxing his boss in.
“How and when does this end?
Or is it an open-ended commitment of American lives and resources?
What will the investment produce in the long run?”
The White House shelved the deliberations over Afghanistan three weeks ago, after an initial Pentagon proposal to deploy up to 5,000 additional American troops ran into fierce resistance from Mr. Bannon, an ardent nationalist, and other political advisers.
In the West Wing, some aides have taken to calling Afghanistan “McMaster’s war.”
Undeterred, General McMaster plans to bring the debate back to the front burner this coming week, a senior administration official said.
But as he does so, the Pentagon appears to be moving toward a smaller recommendation, in which America’s allies would supply half the new troops.
Historically, the United States has supplied about two-thirds of the soldiers in Afghanistan.
That proposal depends on nailing down commitments from NATO and other allies — a task that former officials said had gotten harder after Mr. Trump’s stormy visit to Europe, where he chided allies for not paying their fair share of the alliance’s upkeep and declined to reaffirm America’s commitment to mutual defense.
“Trump has made it harder, not easier, to follow the U.S. lead,” said Douglas E. Lute, a former ambassador to NATO who advised both Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush on Afghanistan.
“Questioning U.S. leadership makes it more difficult for the allies to send troops into harm’s way.”
While the parallels between the Trump and Obama administrations are striking, there are important differences.
Mr. Trump has shown his generals more deference than did Mr. Obama.
In 2009, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Obama’s secretary of state, had a significant voice in the debate, though she formed an alliance with the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, and the regional commander at the time, Gen. David H. Petraeus.
Now, current and former generals all but monopolize the debate.
The White House has also delegated military decisions like the recent order by the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., to drop the most powerful conventional weapon in the American arsenal on Islamic State fighters in a tunnel complex there.
The troop numbers under consideration are far more modest.
In 2009, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, then the top commander in Afghanistan, recommended 40,000 to Mr. Obama.
And Mr. Trump did not run for office promising to turn around the war in Afghanistan, as Mr. Obama did.
In fact, Mr. Trump said next to nothing about the Afghan war during the 2016 campaign.
His views on the subject are best gauged through his posts on Twitter in 2012 and 2013, when the war was a much bigger news story than it is today.
“It is time to get out of Afghanistan,” Mr. Trump wrote on Feb. 27, 2012.
“We are building roads and schools for people that hate us.
It is not in our national interests.”
“Why are we continuing to train these Afghanis who then shoot our soldiers in the back?” he wrote on Aug. 21, 2012.
“Afghanistan is a complete waste.
Time to come home!” “I agree with Pres.
Obama on Afghanistan,” Mr. Trump said on Jan. 14, 2013.
“We should have a speedy withdrawal.
Why should we keep wasting our money — rebuild the U.S.!” But Mr. Trump is discovering, as Mr. Obama did, that extricating the United States is harder than it appears.
General McMaster and other advisers warn that without reinforcements for the Afghan Army, the security situation in Afghanistan will get even more precarious than it is now, potentially creating more sanctuaries for Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.
Currently, the international security force assisting the Afghan Army has about 13,000 troops, of which about 8,400 are American soldiers.
Under an initial plan, which General Nicholson recommended to Congress in February, the United States would send 3,000 to 5,000 additional troops, including hundreds of Special Operations forces.
Such a deployment would allow American advisers to train and assist a more Afghan forces, and it would place American troops closer to the front lines at lower levels in the chain of command.
For both General McMaster and Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, Afghanistan was a profound experience — but in different ways.
General Mattis commanded a brigade in the early days of fighting after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
He earned a reputation as a swaggering warrior who would turn up in a foxhole with his troops.
General McMaster headed an anticorruption task force that worked mostly out of the capital, Kabul, after Mr. Obama’s troop surge.
He quarreled with Afghan officials and warlords in an often-futile effort to make sure billions of dollars in American aid went to the right places.
“Running an anticorruption task force in Afghanistan makes being Donald Trump’s national security adviser look easy,” said John A. Nagl, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and an expert in counterinsurgency strategy.
Both Mr. Mattis and General McMaster are steeped in counterinsurgency doctrine — the strategy that helped lead Mr. Obama to order a deployment of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in 2009.
But Mr. Nagl said both had reason to be more cautious this time: Mr. Mattis had scars from the heavy losses borne by the Marines there, while General McMaster’s exposure to rampant corruption would rob him of any illusions that a few thousand new troops could turn around Afghanistan.
“He understands how arduous, how grinding, how interminable this is going to be,” Mr. Nagl said.
“But what is the alternative?”
That question is echoing again in the hallways of the West Wing — and the people asking it have Mr. Trump’s ear.
Mr. Bannon, who was a powerful force behind Mr. Trump’s decision to leave the Paris climate accord, has recovered some of his influence in the wake of that debate.
Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, remains a crucial voice, despite his troubles over reported links to Russia.
Though he has not taken a position on troops, his aides say he views his role as making sure the president gets genuine options.
Other officials may weigh in, too.
John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security and another retired general, holds weight with Mr. Trump.
His son was killed in combat in Afghanistan.
Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson may be exerting behind-the-scenes influence already.
The debate over Afghanistan abruptly slowed down after officials at the State Department expressed concern that General McMaster was “jamming through” a troop decision.
Still, Mr. Trump’s heavy reliance on military commanders risks a repeat of what some critics viewed as a weakness of the Obama administration’s troop debate, even with Mrs. Clinton’s participation: its overemphasis on a military solution.
“This whole decision is being seen too narrowly, through a military prism,” said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan under Mr. Obama.
“It has to be seen in a more integrated way.
It requires a more aggressive diplomatic component.”
For years, Republicans savaged Democrats for supporting the Affordable Care Act, branding the lawwith some rhetorical licenseas a government takeover of health care.Now, cast out of power in Washington and most state capitals, Democrats and activist leaders seeking political redemption have embraced an unlikely-seeming cause: an actual government takeover of health care.
At rallies and in town hall meetings, and in a collection of blue-state legislatures, liberal Democrats have pressed lawmakers, with growing impatience, to support the creation of a single-payer system, in which the state or federal government would supplant private health insurance with a program of public coverage.
And in California on Thursday, the Democrat-controlled State Senate approved a preliminary plan for enacting single-payer system, the first serious attempt to do so there since then-Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, vetoed legislation in 2006 and 2008.
With Republicans in full control of the federal government, there is no prospect that Democrats can put in place a policy of government-guaranteed medicine on the national level in the near future.
And fiscal and logistical obstacles may be insurmountable even in solidly liberal states like California and New York.
Yet as Democrats regroup from their 2016 defeat, leaders say the party has plainly shifted well to the left on the issue, setting the stage for a larger battle over the health care system in next year’s congressional elections and the 2020 presidential race.
Their liberal base, emboldened by Senator Bernie Sanders’s forceful advocacy of government-backed health care last year, is increasingly unsatisfied with the Affordable Care Act and is demanding more drastic changes to the private health insurance system.
In a sign of shifting sympathies, most House Democrats have now endorsed a single-payer proposal.
Party strategists say they expect that the 2020 presidential nominee will embrace a broader version of public health coverage than any Democratic standard-bearer has in decades.
RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United and the California Nurses Association, powerful labor groups that back single-payer care, said the issue had reached a “boiling point” on the left.
Supporters of universal health care, including activists with Ms. DeMoro’s union, repeatedly interrupted speakers at the California Democratic Party’s convention in May, challenging party leaders to embrace socialized medicine.
Demonstrators waving signs with single-payer slogans have become a regular feature at town hall meetings hosted by members of Congress.
“There is a cultural shift,” said Ms. DeMoro, who was a prominent backer of Mr. Sanders.
“Health care is now seen as something everyone deserves.
It’s like a national light went off.” Representative Rick Nolan of Minnesota, a populist Democrat whose district voted for President Trump by a wide margin, said he had rarely seen core Democratic voters as enthusiastic about an issue as they were about single-payer health care.
Mr. Nolan said he would support creating a state-level system in Minnesota, but believed the party’s goal should be a national law.
He warned Democrats against being too cautious on health care or trusting that they could passively reap the benefits of Republican missteps, saying that his party needed a more boldly “aspirational” health care platform.
Rank-and-file Democrats, Mr. Nolan said, “are energized in a way I have not witnessed in a long, long time.”
At this point, state and federal single-payer proposals appear mainly to embody the sweeping ambitions of a frustrated party, rather than to map a clear way forward on policy.
A handful of legislators in Democratic states — some positioning themselves to run for higher office — have proposed single-payer bills, including in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
Only in California does the legislation appear to have at least a modest chance of being approved this year.
Even there, State Senator Ricardo Lara, an author of the bill, said his legislation would not clear the State Assembly without detailing how expanded coverage would be financed.
The proposal currently lacks a complete funding plan.
The bill would mandate far more comprehensive access to health care, with no out-of-pocket costs, for all California residents at an estimated cost of $400 billion annually.
Roughly half would come from existing public money spent on health care, but the rest would require new taxes.
Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat who once campaigned for president supporting single-payer care, has questioned how the state can plausibly foot the bill.
Should California enact a single-payer law, it would still require a waiver from Washington to redirect federal funding to the state program — which might be difficult with Trump appointees running the Department of Health and Human Services.
But Mr. Lara said that Mr. Trump’s election, and subsequent Republican efforts to unwind the Affordable Care Act, had upended the conversation about health care among Democrats.
He said he would have been unlikely to press for single-payer under a Democratic president.
“I no longer have the luxury of going step by step,” Mr. Lara said.
“We need to do a single-payer or we’re going to be in a position where millions of people are going to lose coverage.”
There remains considerable skepticism among senior Democrats about a single-payer plan, and party strategists fear that proposing a potentially divisive health care agenda would offer Republicans a welcome diversion from their own tortured wrangling over the Affordable Care Act.
At a briefing with reporters last month, the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, replied with a flat “no” when asked if Democrats should make single-payer a central theme in 2018.
She said state-level action was more appropriate, though she said she supported the idea in concept.
“The comfort level with the broader base of the American people is not there yet,” Ms. Pelosi said.
In the past, top Democrats — including President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton — have suggested more incremental approaches, proposing the creation of an optional government health plan that people could buy into or lowering the eligibility age for Medicare.
Democrats were unable to pass either of those measures into law the last time they controlled Congress and the White House, in 2010, because they failed to draw unanimous support from both liberal and centrist Democrats.
Mr. Obama never tried to create a full single-payer system, and Mrs. Clinton described the idea as unachievable during the 2016 campaign.
A study published in January by the Pew Research Center found that about 40 percent of Democrats favored a single-payer system, including a slight majority of self-described liberal Democrats.
Among all Americans, support was markedly lower: Just 28 percent said government should be the sole provider of care.
But a sizable majority — about three in five Americans — said the government had a responsibility to ensure everyone had health care.
And the idea of single-payer health care has stirred interest among some business leaders, like Warren E. Buffett and Charles Munger, who see health care costs as a drag on the economy.
Karen Politz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation who has tracked the single-payer debate for years, said it would be difficult to persuade the country to move to an all-government health care system — a disruptive process that would likely lead to higher taxes in place of the premiums people now pay to insurance companies.
Even if most consumers paid less over all, as single-payer proponents claim, Ms. Politz said, morphing premiums into taxes would be culturally and politically challenging.
“It does involve big government, and it’s kind of baked into the American psyche that we resist that,” she said.
Still, Democrats acknowledge that there is a palpable appetite on the left for comprehensive government health care.
A number of the party’s potential 2020 presidential contenders, including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, have signaled support for some version of universal government care, though neither Mr. Booker nor Ms. Harris has endorsed the single-payer proposal in his or her home state.
In the House, 112 of the 193 Democrats have co-sponsored a single-payer bill proposed by Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and called the “Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act.”
Until recently, the bill had attracted a fraction of that support.
The Conyers proposal would effectively void the current private health insurance system and impose new taxes on wealthy people and on certain kinds of income to pay for benefits.
In May, the bill won a symbolically telling endorsement from Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the Democratic caucus and a leading possible successor for Ms. Pelosi.
Mr. Crowley said his support for the bill was “part practical, part aspirational,” conceding that there was no immediate path to making it law.
“You can’t do this with 110 votes,” he said.
Another night of terrorism unfolded in Britain on Saturday with two attacks that killed six civilians in the center of the capital, London police said.At least one of the dead was killed when a van careered onto the sidewalk along London Bridge, mowing down pedestrians.
The London Ambulance Service said it had brought 48 injured to five hospitals.
The police said they killed three attackers, which they believed to be the total number of assailants.
Witnesses reported that at least one man jumped out of the van wielding a large knife and ran into the nearby Borough Market, a popular spot for pubs and restaurants on the southern side of the Thames.
Heavily armed police responded to the bridge attack, which took place just after 10 p.m., and more officers rushed to investigate reports of stabbings at the market.
The police shot and killed three attackers there, within eight minutes of receiving the first emergency call, they said.
Though no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, they hit a nation still reeling from the shock of the bombing in Manchester almost two weeks ago when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the doors of an Ariana Grande concert.
Twenty-two people were killed, including many children.
Saturday’s attack was reminiscent of another on Westminster Bridge on March 22, when Khalid Masood, 52, drove a car into pedestrians, killing four people.
He then stabbed a police officer to death before being shot and killed near Parliament.
The police treated that attack, in which 50 were injured, as “Islamist-related terrorism.”
And now, as Britain prepares for national elections in less than a week, it must cope with more attacks in the most ordinary of places, London Bridge on a Saturday night, as people walked about enjoying the spring evening.
The mood in London was shock and anger, with the center of the city saturated all night with the sound of sirens.
People were told to run, or hide and silence their cellphones as the police searched for assailants.
There was panic that a third stabbing in the Vauxhall area at about the same time as the assaults near the bridge might have been part of a coordinated attack, but the police later declared that incident unrelated.
The attacks came a few days before a snap election that has major implications for the country’s future outside the European Union.
Across London, and Britain, there was a sense of fear that a way of life was under attack, but also a determination to carry on.
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called it a “deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners,” and it was also condemned by the leader of the main opposition party, Jeremy Corbyn.
The office of Theresa May, the prime minister, announced that she will chair a meeting of the government emergency response committee, known as Cobra, on Sunday.
A White House spokesman said President Trump was briefed by his national security aides on the unfolding events in London.
He spoke with Mrs. May, offering his condolences for the attacks and praising the response of the police, White House officials said.
He offered the full support of the United States government in investigating the attacks.
No motive has been ascribed to the attackers, but on the messaging app Telegram, members and supporters of the Islamic State shared a poster that calls for supporters to attack people with guns, knives and trucks during the month of Ramadan, which began last weekend.
On Saturday night ambulances rushed to the scene, people fled in panic, restaurants and hotels were evacuated, and helicopters flew overhead.
Witnesses described horrible scenes.
Holly Jones, a BBC reporter who was on the bridge when the van crashed, said it was driven by a man and was “probably traveling at about 50 miles an hour.”
She said that at least five people were being treated for injuries after the vehicle drove on the sidewalk and hit them.
“He swerved right round me and then hit about five or six people,” Ms. Jones said.
“He hit about two people in front of me and then three behind.”
A witness, who identified himself as Andrew, said he was in the area at a bar, heard “a massive bang” and saw a van hitting the rail of the road.
“Next 10 seconds later, there was a guy with a big knife, I mean, a big knife,” he told LBC Radio.
Andrew said he jumped over a fence, got to a footpath and there was “a dead guy lying on the floor.”
He hid for a few seconds in bushes nearby, then, he said, “I ran for my life.”
At the market, Ben, who did not give his last name, told the BBC that he and his wife, Natalie, saw someone being stabbed.
“I saw a man in red with quite a large blade — I don’t know the measurement, I guess maybe 10 inches,” Ben said.
“He was stabbing a man.
He stabbed him about three times fairly calmly.”
Ben added, “He was being stabbed quite coldly and he slumped to the ground.”
He then said someone threw a table and a bottle at the man with the knife, but “then we heard three gunshots and we ran.”
A man named Gerard told the BBC that he saw men stabbing everyone they could and shouting “this is for Allah.”
He saw three men with knives “and they stabbed a girl,” he said.
“So I follow them, toward Borough Market, they were running into the pubs and bars and stabbing everyone.
They were running up, saying this is for Allah, and they run up and stabbed this girl 10, maybe 15 times.”
Lorna Murray, 44, said she was about to drive over London Bridge when traffic stopped and people ran toward her car.
“We ducked down in our car, assuming there was a stabbing,” she said.
“Then this young couple started banging on the doors trying to get into our car for safety.
We took them in but couldn’t let anyone else in because we had a baby in the back.”
The police told everyone to leave their cars and get away.
“When I got out the car everything was a blur, but I saw a woman with blood all over her face,” she said.
Tim Hodge, 37, a security officer at a nearby office building on the south side of the bridge, described “huge crowds” running and screaming.
“There was so much panic and so many of the people were drunk, which made them more hysterical,” he said.
Alex Shellum was in the Mudlark pub, underneath London Bridge, with his girlfriend.
He told the BBC about an injured woman who came into the pub: “She was bleeding heavily from the neck.
It appeared that her throat had been cut.”
Gabriele Sciotto, a photographer returning from a bar, saw the police confronting three men outside the Wheatsheaf bar on Stoney Street and ordering them to get down.
Two of the men were shot by police, he said.
“They looked like they had some explosive belts,” Mr. Sciotto said.
“The police didn’t know what was going on honestly.
They shouted at them to go down, to stop moving.
It was very chaotic.”
The police said the suspects were wearing what looked like explosive vests but they were later established to be hoaxes.
Mr. Sciotto took a photograph, which he later posted to Instagram, that appeared to show at least two men on the ground.
“At the moment these people were shot it was just me, the men and the police,” Mr. Sciotto said.
The campaign ad appeared during the presidential contest of 2008.
Rapid-fire images of belching smokestacks and melting ice sheets were followed by a soothing narrator who praised a candidate who had stood up to President George W. Bush and “sounded the alarm on global warming.”It
was not made for a Democrat, but for Senator John McCain, who had just secured the Republican nomination.
It is difficult to reconcile the Republican Party of 2008 with the party of 2017, whose leader, President Trump, has called global warming a hoax, reversed environmental policies that Mr. McCain advocated on his run for the White House, and this past week announced that he would take the nation out of the Paris climate accord, which was to bind the globe in an effort to halt the planet’s warming.
The Republican Party’s fast journey from debating how to combat human-caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist is a story of big political money, Democratic hubris in the Obama years and a partisan chasm that grew over nine years like a crack in the Antarctic shelf, favoring extreme positions and uncompromising rhetoric over cooperation and conciliation.
“Most Republicans still do not regard climate change as a hoax,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist who worked for Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign.
“But the entire climate change debate has now been caught up in the broader polarization of American politics.”
“In some ways,” he added, “it’s become yet another of the long list of litmus test issues that determine whether or not you’re a good Republican.”
Since Mr. McCain ran for president on climate credentials that were stronger than his opponent Barack Obama’s, the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases from fossil fuels to the dangerous warming of the planet has grown stronger.
Scientists have for the first time drawn concrete links between the planet’s warming atmosphere and changes that affect Americans’ daily lives and pocketbooks, from tidal flooding in Miami to prolonged water shortages in the Southwest to decreasing snow cover at ski resorts.
That scientific consensus was enough to pull virtually all of the major nations along.
Conservative-leaning governments in Britain, France, Germany and Japan all signed on to successive climate change agreements.
Yet when Mr. Trump pulled the United States from the Paris accord, the Senate majority leader, the speaker of the House and every member of the elected Republican leadership were united in their praise.
Those divisions did not happen by themselves.
Republican lawmakers were moved along by a campaign carefully crafted by fossil fuel industry players, most notably Charles D. and David H. Koch, the Kansas-based billionaires who run a chain of refineries (which can process 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day) as well as a subsidiary that owns or operates 4,000 miles of pipelines that move crude oil.
Government rules intended to slow climate change are “making people’s lives worse rather than better,” Charles Koch explained in a rare interview last year with Fortune, arguing that despite the costs, these efforts would make “very little difference in the future on what the temperature or the weather will be.”
Republican leadership has also been dominated by lawmakers whose constituents were genuinely threatened by policies that would raise the cost of burning fossil fuels, especially coal.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, always sensitive to the coal fields in his state, rose through the ranks to become majority leader.
Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming also climbed into leadership, then the chairmanship of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, as a champion of his coal state.
Mr. Trump has staffed his White House and cabinet with officials who have denied, or at least questioned, the existence of global warming.
And he has adopted the Koch language, almost to the word.
On Thursday, as Mr. Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal, he at once claimed that the Paris accord would cost the nation millions of jobs and that it would do next to nothing for the climate.
Beyond the White House, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Science Committee, held a hearing this spring aimed at debunking climate science, calling the global scientific consensus “exaggerations, personal agendas and questionable predictions.”
A small core of Republican lawmakers — most of whom are from swing districts and are at risk of losing their seats next year — are taking modest steps like introducing a nonbinding resolution in the House in March urging Congress to accept the risks presented by climate change.
But in Republican political circles, speaking out on the issue, let alone pushing climate policy, is politically dangerous.
So for the most part, these moderate Republicans are biding their time, until it once again becomes safe for Republicans to talk more forcefully about climate change.
The question is how long that will take.
“With 40 percent of Florida’s population at risk from sea-level rise, my state is on the front lines of climate change,” said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida.
“South Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives.”
It was called the “No Climate Tax” pledge, drafted by a new group called Americans for Prosperity that was funded by the Koch brothers.
Its single sentence read: “I will oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.”
Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, was the first member of Congress to sign it in July 2008.
The effort picked up steam the next year after the House of Representatives passed what is known as cap-and-trade legislation, a concept invented by conservative Reagan-era economists.
The idea was to create a statutory limit, or cap, on the overall amount of a certain type of pollution that could be emitted.
Businesses could then buy and sell permits to pollute, choosing whether to invest more in pollution permits, or in cleaner technology that would then save them money and allow them to sell their allotted permits.
The administration of the first President George Bush successfully deployed the first national cap-and-trade system in 1990 to lower emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain.
Mr. McCain pushed a cap-and-trade proposal to fight climate change.
“I thought we could get it done,” recalled Henry A. Waxman, a retired House Democrat who led the cap-and-trade push in 2009.
“We just had two candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties who had run for president and agreed that climate change was a real threat.”
Conservative activists saw the legislative effort as an opportunity to transform the climate debate.
With the help of a small army of oil-industry-funded academics like Wei-Hock Soon of Harvard Smithsonian and think tanks like the Competitive Enterprise Institute, they had been working to discredit academics and government climate change scientists.
The lawyer and conservative activist Chris Horner, whose legal clients have included the coal industry, gathered documents through the Freedom of Information Act to try to embarrass and further undermine the climate change research.
Myron Ebell, a senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, worked behind the scenes to make sure Republican offices in Congress knew about Mr. Horner’s work — although at the time, many viewed Mr. Ebell skeptically, as an extremist pushing out-of-touch views.
In 2009, hackers broke into a climate research program at the University of East Anglia in England, then released the emails that conservatives said raised doubts about the validity of the research.
In one email, a scientist talked of using a statistical “trick” in a chart illustrating a recent sharp warming trend.
The research was ultimately validated, but damage was done.
As Congress moved toward actually passing climate change legislation, a fringe issue had become a part of the political mainstream.
“That was the turning point,” Mr. Horner said.
The House passed the cap-and-trade bill by seven votes, but it went nowhere in the Senate — Mr. Obama’s first major legislative defeat.
Unshackled by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision and other related rulings, which ended corporate campaign finance restrictions, Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity started an all-fronts campaign with television advertising, social media and cross-country events aimed at electing lawmakers who would ensure that the fossil fuel industry would not have to worry about new pollution regulations.
Their first target: unseating Democratic lawmakers such as Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Perriello of Virginia, who had voted for the House cap-and-trade bill, and replacing them with Republicans who were seen as more in step with struggling Appalachia, and who pledged never to push climate change measures.
But Americans for Prosperity also wanted to send a message to Republicans.
Until 2010, some Republicans ran ads in House and Senate races showing their support for green energy.
“After that, it disappeared from Republican ads,” said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity.
“Part of that was the polling, and part of it was the visceral example of what happened to their colleagues who had done that.”
What happened was clear.
Republicans who asserted support for climate change legislation or the seriousness of the climate threat saw their money dry up or, worse, a primary challenger arise.
“It told Republicans that we were serious,” Mr. Phillips said, “that we would spend some serious money against them.”
By the time Election Day 2010 arrived, 165 congressional members and candidates had signed Americans for Prosperity’s “No Climate Tax” pledge.
Most were victorious.
“The midterm election was a clear rejection of policies like the cap-and-trade energy taxes that threaten our still-fragile economy,” said James Valvo, then Americans for Prosperity’s government affairs director, in a statement issued the day after the November 2010 election.
Eighty-three of the 92 new members of Congress had signed the pledge.
Even for congressional veterans, that message was not missed.
Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who once called climate change “a serious problem” and co-sponsored a bill to promote energy-efficient light bulbs, tacked right after the 2010 elections as he battled to be chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee against Joe Barton, a Texan who mocked human-caused climate change.
Mr. Upton deleted references to climate change from his website.
“If you look, the last year was the warmest year on record, the warmest decade on record.
I accept that,” he offered that fall.
“I do not say that it’s man-made.”
Mr. Upton, who has received more than $2 million in campaign donations from oil and gas companies and electric utilities over the course of his career, won the chairmanship and has coasted comfortably to re-election since.
Two years later, conservative “super PACs” took aim at Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a senior Republican who publicly voiced climate concerns, backed the creation of a Midwestern cap-and-trade program and drove a Prius.
After six Senate terms, Mr. Lugar lost his primary to a Tea Party challenger, Richard E. Mourdock.
Although Mr. Lugar says other reasons contributed, he and his opponents say his public views on climate change played a crucial role.
“In my own campaign, there were people who felt strongly enough about my views on climate change to use it to help defeat me, and other Republicans are very sensitive to that possibility,” Mr. Lugar said in an interview.
“So even if they privately believe we ought to do something about it, they’re reticent, especially with the Republican president taking the views he is now taking.”
After winning re-election in 2012, Mr. Obama understood his second-term agenda would have to rely on executive authority, not legislation that would go nowhere in the Republican-majority Congress.
And climate change was the great unfinished business of his first term.
To finish it, he would deploy a rarely used provision in the Clean Air Act of 1970, which gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to issue regulations on carbon dioxide.
“If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will,” he declared in his 2013 State of the Union address.
The result was the Clean Power Plan, which would significantly cut planet-warming emissions by forcing the closing of hundreds of heavy-polluting coal-fired power plants.
The end run around Congress had consequences of its own.
To Republican (and some Democratic) critics, the Clean Power Plan exemplified everything they opposed about Mr. Obama: He seemed to them imperious, heavy-handed, pleasing to the elites on the East and West Coasts and in the capitals of Europe, but callous to the blue-collar workers of coal and oil country.
“It fed into this notion of executive overreach,” said Heather Zichal, who advised Mr. Obama on climate policy.
“I don’t think there was a good enough job on managing the narrative.”
Republicans who had supported the climate change agenda began to defect and have since stayed away.
“On the issue of climate change, I think it’s happening,” Mr. McCain said in a CNN podcast interview last April.
But, he said, “The president decided, at least in the last couple years if not more, to rule by edict.”
Mr. Obama’s political opponents saw the climate rules as a ripe opportunity.
“When the president went the regulatory route, it gave our side more confidence,” Mr. Phillips said.
“It hardened and broadened Republican opposition to this agenda.”
Starting in early 2014, the opponents of the rule — including powerful lawyers and lobbyists representing many of America’s largest manufacturing and industrial interests — regularly gathered in a large conference room at the national headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, overlooking the White House.
They drafted a long-game legal strategy to undermine Mr. Obama’s climate regulations in a coordinated campaign that brought together 28 state attorneys general and major corporations to form an argument that they expected to eventually take to the Supreme Court.
They presented it not as an environmental fight but an economic one, against a government that was trying to vastly and illegally expand its authority.
“This is the most significant wholesale regulation of energy that the United States has ever seen, by any agency,” Roger R. Martella Jr., a former E.P.A. lawyer who then represented energy companies, said at a gathering of industry advocates, making an assertion that has not been tested.
Republican attorneys general gathered at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia in August 2015 for their annual summer retreat, with some special guests: four executives from Murray Energy, one of the nation’s largest coal mining companies.
Murray was struggling to avoid bankruptcy — a fate that had befallen several other coal mining companies already, given the slump in demand for their product and the rise of natural gas, solar and wind energy.
The coal industry came to discuss a new part of the campaign to reverse the country’s course on climate change.
Litigation was going to be needed, the industry executives and the Republican attorneys general agreed, to block the Obama administration’s climate agenda — at least until a new president could be elected.
West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, led the session, “The Dangerous Consequences of the Clean Power Plan & Other E.P.A. Rules,” which included, according to the agenda, Scott Pruitt, then the attorney general of Oklahoma; Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general; and Geoffrey Barnes, a corporate lawyer for Murray, which had donated $250,000 to the Republican attorneys general political group.
That same day, Mr. Morrissey would step outside the hotel to announce that he and other attorneys general would sue in federal court to try to stop the Clean Power Plan, which he called “the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation’s history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats.”
Mr. Pruitt quickly became a national point person for industry-backed groups and a magnet for millions of dollars of campaign contributions, as the fossil fuel lobby looked for a fresh face with conservative credentials and ties to the evangelical community.
“Pruitt was instrumental — he and A.G. Morrisey,” said Thomas Pyle, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries, an adviser to Mr. Trump’s transition team and the president of a pro-fossil fuel Washington research organization, the Institute for Energy Research.
“They led the charge and made it easier for other states to get involved.
Some states were keeping their powder dry, but Pruitt was very out front and aggressive.”
After the litigation was filed — by Mr. Morrissey and Mr. Pruitt, along with other attorneys general who attended the Greenbrier meeting — Murray Energy sued in the federal court case as well, just as had been planned.
In February 2016, the Supreme Court indicated that it would side with opponents of the rule, moving by a 5-4 vote to grant a request by the attorneys general and corporate players to block the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while the case worked its way through the federal courts.
When Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, he did not appear to have a clear understanding of the nation’s climate change policies.
Nor, at the start of his campaign, did he appear to have any specific plan to prioritize a huge legal push to roll those policies back.
Mr. Trump had, in 2012, said on Twitter, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”
But he had also, in 2009, joined dozens of other business leaders to sign a full-page ad in the The New York Times urging Mr. Obama to push a global climate change pact being negotiated in Copenhagen, and to “strengthen and pass United States legislation” to tackle climate change.
However, it did not go unnoticed that coal country was giving his presidential campaign a wildly enthusiastic embrace, as miners came out in full force for Mr. Trump, stoking his populist message.
And the surest way for Mr. Trump to win cheers from coal crowds was to aim at an easy target: Mr. Obama’s climate rules.
Hillary Clinton did not help her cause when she said last spring that her climate policies would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”
In May 2016, Mr. Trump addressed one of the largest rallies of his campaign: an estimated crowd of over 10,000 in Charleston, W.Va., where the front rows were crammed with mine workers.
“I’m thinking about miners all over the country,” he said, eliciting cheers.
“We’re going to put miners back to work.”
“They didn’t used to have all these rules and regulations that make it impossible to compete,” he added.
“We’re going to take it all off the table.”
Then an official from the West Virginia Coal Association handed the candidate a miner’s hat.
As he put it on, giving the miners a double thumbs-up, “The place just went nuts, and he loved it,” recalled Barry Bennett, a former adviser to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.
“And the miners started showing up at everything.
They were a beaten lot, and they saw him as a savior.
So he started using the ‘save coal’ portions of the speech again and again.”
Mr. Trump’s advisers embraced the miners as emblematic of the candidate’s broader populist appeal.
“The coal miners were the perfect case for what he was talking about,” Mr. Bennett said, “the idea that for the government in Washington, it’s all right for these people to suffer for the greater good — that federal power is more important than your little lives.”
Mr. Trump took on as an informal campaign adviser Robert E. Murray — chief executive of the same coal company that had been working closely for years with the Republican attorneys general to unwind the Obama environmental legacy.
Mr. Murray, a brash and folksy populist who started working in coal mines as a teenager, is an unabashed skeptic of climate science.
The coal magnate and Mr. Trump had a natural chemistry, and where Mr. Trump lacked the legal and policy background to unwind climate policy, Mr. Murray was happy to step in.
“I thank my lord, Jesus Christ, for the election of Donald Trump,” Mr. Murray said soon after his new friend won the White House.
Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Ebell, the Competitive Enterprise Institute fellow who had worked for years to undermine the legitimacy of established climate science, to head the transition team at E.P.A.
Mr. Ebell immediately began pushing for an agenda of gutting the Obama climate regulations and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.
When it came time to translate Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to coal country into policy, Mr. Murray and others helped choose the perfect candidate: Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general.
Mr. Trump, who had never met Mr. Pruitt before his election, offered him the job of E.P.A. administrator — putting him in a position to dismantle the environmental rules that he had long sought to fight in court.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump wanted to be seen delivering on the promises he had made to the miners.
As controversies piled up in his young administration, he sought comfort in the approval of his base.
In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to begin unwinding the Clean Power Plan — and he did so at a large public ceremony at the E.P.A., flanked by coal miners and coal executives.
Mr. Murray beamed in the audience.
Meanwhile, a battle raged at the White House over whether to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement.
Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, urged him to remain in, cautioning that withdrawing could be devastating to the United States’ foreign policy credentials.
Murray Energy — despite its enormous clout with Mr. Trump and his top environmental official — boasts a payroll with only 6,000 employees.
The coal industry nationwide is responsible for about 160,000 jobs, with just 65,000 directly in mining, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.
By comparison, General Electric alone has 104,000 employees in the United States, and Apple has 80,000.
Their chief executives openly pressed Mr. Trump to stick with Paris, as did dozens of other major corporations that have continued to support regulatory efforts to combat climate change.
But these voices did not have clout in Washington, either in Congress or at the White House, when it comes to energy policy.
Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, backed by Mr. Pruitt, told the president that pulling out of the deal would mean a promise kept to his base.
“It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France,” Mr. Trump said in his Rose Garden speech on Thursday.
“It is time to make America great again.”
The recognition that human activity is influencing the climate developed slowly, but a scientific consensus can be traced to a conference in southern Austria in October 1985.
Among the 100 or so attendees who gathered in the city of Villach, nestled in the mountains along the Drava River, was Bert Bolin, a Swedish meteorologist and a pioneer in using computers to model the climate.
Dr. Bolin helped steer the conference to its conclusion: “It is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man’s history,” he wrote in the conference’s 500-page report.
While the politics of climate change in the United States has grown more divided since then, the scientific community has united: Global warming is having an impact, scientists say, with sea levels rising along with the extremity of weather events.
Most of the debate is about the extent of those impacts — how high the seas may rise, or how intense and frequent heavy storms or heat waves may be.
In recent years, many climate scientists have also dropped their reluctance to pin significant weather events on climate change.
Studies have shown that certain events — a 2015 Australian heat wave, floods in France last year and recent high temperatures in the Arctic — were made more likely because of global warming.
But in Congress, reluctance to embrace that science has had no political downsides, at least among Republicans.
“We don’t yet have an example of where someone has paid a political price being on that side of it,” said Michael Steel, who served as press secretary for the former House speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and the current House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, during his 2012 run as Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential choice.
Instead, the messages of Mr. Pruitt still dominate.
“This is an historic restoration of American economic independence — one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes,” Mr. Pruitt said on Thursday, stepping to the Rose Garden lectern after Mr. Trump.
“We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.”
American voters — even many Republicans — recognize that climate change is starting to affect their lives.
About 70 percent think global warming is happening, and about 53 percent think it is caused by human activities, according to a recent study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
About 69 percent support limiting carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants.
But most public opinion polls find that voters rank the environment last or nearly last among the issues that they vote on.
And views are divided based on party affiliation.
In 2001, 46 percent of Democrats said they worried “a great deal” about climate change, compared with 29 percent of Republicans, according to a Gallup tracking poll on the issue.
This year, concern among Democrats has reached 66 percent.
Among Republicans, it has fallen, to 18 percent.
Until people vote on the issue, Republicans will find it politically safer to question climate science and policy than to alienate moneyed groups like Americans for Prosperity.
There will be exceptions.
The 2014 National Climate Assessment, a report produced by 14 federal agencies, concluded that climate change is responsible for much of the flooding now plaguing many of the Miami area’s coastal residents, soaking homes and disrupting businesses, and Representative Curbelo is talking about it.
“This is a local issue for me,” Mr. Curbelo said.
“Even conservatives in my district see the impact.
It’s flooding, and it’s happening now.”
Mr. Curbelo helped create the House Climate Solutions Caucus, 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats who say they are committed to tackling climate change.
Mr. Curbelo is confident that as the impact of climate change spreads, so will the willingness of his Republican colleagues to join him.
Outside of Congress, a small number of establishment conservatives, including a handful of leaders from the Reagan administration, have begun pushing Washington to act on climate change.
Earlier this year, James A. Baker III, one of the Republican Party’s more eminent senior figures, met with senior White House officials to urge them to consider incorporating a carbon tax as part of a broader tax overhaul package — a way to both pay for proposed cuts to corporate tax rates and help save the planet.
A Reagan White House senior economist, Art Laffer; a former secretary of state, George P. Shultz; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., George W. Bush’s final Treasury secretary, have also pushed the idea.
“There are members from deep-red districts who have approached me about figuring out how to become part of this effort,” Mr. Curbelo said.
“I know we have the truth on our side.
So I’m confident that we’ll win — eventually.”
On one level, President Trump reacted to Saturday night’s terrorist attack in London much as his predecessors might have.
He expressed solidarity and telephoned Britain’s prime minister to offer condolences.
“WE ARE WITH YOU,” he wrote to Britons.But even as the investigation into the attack was getting underway, Mr. Trump wasted little time in using the episode to defend his hotly disputed travel ban on visitors from certain predominantly Muslim countries and to criticize the judges who have blocked it.
And by Sunday morning, he decided to go after the mayor of London as not being tough enough on terrorism.
Along the way, he mischaracterized the mayor’s position, renewed a trans-Atlantic feud stretching back a year and widened his rift with the United States’ traditional European allies a bit further.
And he set off a chain reaction in the news media world, triggering partisan reactions that illustrated just how polarized both the United States and the world have become about the uninhibited, Twitter-obsessed president.
Mr. Trump’s penchant for picking fights is well established by now, but it continues to confound and exasperate foreign leaders who are not accustomed to such rough-and-tumble interactions with American presidents.
The niceties of international diplomacy have never had such a reality-show flavor to them in the modern era, but Mr. Trump has thrilled his nationalist base with his “America First” approach, and all the complaints from overseas only seem to embolden him.
The latest contretemps came when Mr. Trump heaped scorn on Mayor Sadiq Khan of London.
“At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’”
Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.
Mr. Trump either misunderstood what Mr. Khan had said or distorted it.
During an interview shown on the BBC, the mayor said he was “appalled and furious that these cowardly terrorists would target” innocent civilians and vowed that “we will never let them win, nor will we allow them to cower our city.”
He went on to say that residents should not worry as they encounter more police officers patrolling the streets.
“Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days,” Mr. Khan said.
“No reason to be alarmed.
One of the things the police, all of us, need to do is make sure we’re as safe as we possibly can be.
I’m reassured that we are one of the safest global cities in the world, if not the safest global city in the world, but we always evolve and review ways to make sure that we remain as safe as we possibly can.”
Mr. Khan’s office later dismissed Mr. Trump’s post, saying the mayor was too busy to reply.
“He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police — including armed officers — on the streets,” his office said in a statement.
The exchange reflected the tensions between Mr. Trump and the United States’ close allies in Europe.
The president returned a little more than a week ago from Belgium and Italy, where he questioned the role of NATO.
Then, once home, he followed up by criticizing Germany on trade and pulling the United States out of the Paris climate change accord.
The friction has been especially acute for more than a year between Mr. Trump and Mr. Khan, the first Muslim to serve as mayor of a major Western European capital.
During last year’s presidential race, Mr. Khan criticized Mr. Trump’s proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States and endorsed Hillary Clinton, prompting an exchange with Mr. Trump’s campaign.
Critics of Mr. Trump in Britain and the United States faulted him for his acrimonious response to the Saturday assault.
“I don’t think that a major terrorist attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticize a mayor who’s trying to organize his city’s response to this attack,” former Vice President Al Gore said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
Damon Wilson, who was President George W. Bush’s top Europe adviser and is now the executive vice president of the Atlantic Council, lamented that the spat only undercut a relationship that mattered to the United States.
“America is safer when we rally our friends and allies against the bad guys rather than pick fights with the good guys,” he said.
But the White House showed no signs of backing down, and a top aide to Mr. Trump amplified the attack shortly afterward.
Dan Scavino Jr., the president’s director of social media, posted a message referring to Mr. Khan’s criticism of Mr. Trump a year ago for his “ignorant view of Muslims.”
Addressing Mr. Khan, Mr. Scavino referred to his “tweet 13 months ago, after you criticized ... now President @realDonaldTrump — and WAKE UP!!!!” Other American officials sought to smooth over the dispute.
“I commend the strong leadership of the @MayorofLondon as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack,” Lewis Lukens, a career diplomat serving as acting American ambassador to London, wrote on Twitter hours later.
This is just the latest time the American Embassy in London has had to manage turbulence in the relationship since Mr. Trump took office.
The London government complained vociferously after the White House aired a conspiracy theory that British intelligence helped President Barack Obama secretly spy on Mr. Trump during last year’s campaign, which Britain denied.
London complained again when American officials leaked details of the investigation into last month’s terrorist bombing in Manchester.
Mr. Trump’s initial arguments about the meaning of Saturday night’s terrorist attack stirred debate both at home and abroad.
“We need the courts to give us back our rights.
We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!” he wrote in one message Saturday night.
“We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people,” he wrote in another on Sunday morning.
“If we don’t get smart it will only get worse.”
“Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now?” he added.
“That’s because they used knives and a truck!”
Mr. Trump first tussled with Mr. Khan publicly last year shortly after Mr. Khan was elected.
At the time, Mr. Trump’s proposed Muslim ban applied to all Muslims from all countries who were not American citizens, but Mr. Trump said he welcomed Mr. Khan’s election and would make an exception for him.
Mr. Khan replied that he wanted no exception and accused Mr. Trump of harboring “ignorant views about Islam.”
Mr. Khan said Mr. Trump would only encourage Muslim alienation from the West.
“He’s playing into the hands of extremists,” he said.
Mr. Scavino, at the time, fired back on Mr. Trump’s behalf, writing on Twitter that it was not ignorance: “It’s called not being ‘politically correct.’
@realDonaldTrump will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!”
The feud continued after Mr. Trump’s election.
In March, after a terrorist attack in London, Donald Trump Jr. posted a link suggesting that Mr. Khan had said terrorist attacks were just “part of living in big city.”
In fact, what Mr. Khan had said was that “part and parcel of living in a great global city” was being vigilant against terrorism and supporting the police.
To Gwen Beatty, a junior at the high school in this proud, struggling, Trump-supporting town, the new science teacher’s lessons on climate change seemed explicitly designed to provoke her.So she provoked him back.
When the teacher, James Sutter, ascribed the recent warming of the Earth to heat-trapping gases released by burning fossil fuels like the coal her father had once mined, she asserted that it could be a result of other, natural causes.
When he described the flooding, droughts and fierce storms that scientists predict within the century if such carbon emissions are not sharply reduced, she challenged him to prove it.
“Scientists are wrong all the time,” she said with a shrug, echoing those celebrating President Trump’s announcement last week that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.
When Mr. Sutter lamented that information about climate change had been removed from the White House website after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, she rolled her eyes.
“It’s his website,” she said.
For his part, Mr. Sutter occasionally fell short of his goal of providing Gwen — the most vocal of a raft of student climate skeptics — with calm, evidence-based responses.
“Why would I lie to you?” he demanded one morning.
“It’s not like I’m making a lot of money here.”
She was, he knew, a straight-A student.
She would have had no trouble comprehending the evidence, embedded in ancient tree rings, ice, leaves and shells, as well as sophisticated computer models, that atmospheric carbon dioxide is the chief culprit when it comes to warming the world.
Or the graph he showed of how sharply it has spiked since the Industrial Revolution, when humans began pumping vast quantities of it into the air.
Thinking it a useful soothing device, Mr. Sutter assented to Gwen’s request that she be allowed to sand the bark off the sections of wood he used to illustrate tree rings during class.
When she did so with an energy that, classmates said, increased during discussion points with which she disagreed, he let it go.
When she insisted that teachers “are supposed to be open to opinions,” however, Mr. Sutter held his ground.
“It’s not about opinions,” he told her. “It’s about the evidence.”
“It’s like you can’t disagree with a scientist or you’re ‘denying science,”’ she sniffed to her friends.
Gwen, 17, could not put her finger on why she found Mr. Sutter, whose biology class she had enjoyed, suddenly so insufferable.
Mr. Sutter, sensing that his facts and figures were not helping, was at a loss.
And the day she grew so agitated by a documentary he was showing that she bolted out of the school left them both shaken.
“I have a runner,” Mr. Sutter called down to the office, switching off the video.
He had chosen the video, an episode from an Emmy-winning series that featured a Christian climate activist and high production values, as a counterpoint to another of Gwen’s objections, that a belief in climate change does not jibe with Christianity.
“It was just so biased toward saying climate change is real,” she said later, trying to explain her flight.
“And that all these people that I pretty much am like are wrong and stupid.”
As more of the nation’s teachers seek to integrate climate science into the curriculum, many of them are reckoning with students for whom suspicion of the subject is deeply rooted.
In rural Wellston, a former coal and manufacturing town seeking its next act, rejecting the key findings of climate science can seem like a matter of loyalty to a way of life already under siege.
Originally tied, perhaps, to economic self-interest, climate skepticism has itself become a proxy for conservative ideals of hard work, small government and what people here call “self-sustainability.” Assiduously promoted by fossil fuel interests, that powerful link to a collective worldview largely explains why just 22 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters in a 2016 poll said they believed that human activity is warming the planet, compared with half of all registered voters.
And the prevailing outlook among his base may in turn have facilitated the president’s move to withdraw from the global agreement to battle rising temperatures.
“What people ‘believe’ about global warming doesn’t reflect what they know,” Dan Kahan, a Yale researcher who studies political polarization, has stressed in talks, papers and blog posts.
“It expresses who they are.”
But public-school science classrooms are also proving to be a rare place where views on climate change may shift, research has found.
There, in contrast with much of adult life, it can be hard to entirely tune out new information.
“Adolescents are still heavily influenced by their parents, but they’re also figuring themselves out,” said Kathryn Stevenson, a researcher at North Carolina State University who studies climate literacy.
Gwen’s father died when she was young, and her mother and uncle, both Trump supporters, doubt climate change as much as she does.
“If she was in math class and teacher told her two plus two equals four and she argued with him about that, I would say she’s wrong,” said her uncle, Mark Beatty.
“But no one knows if she’s wrong.”
As Gwen clashed with her teacher over the notion of human-caused climate change, one of her best friends, Jacynda Patton, was still circling the taboo subject.
“I learned some stuff, that’s all,’’ Jacynda told Gwen, on whom she often relied to supply the $2.40 for school lunch that she could not otherwise afford.
Hired a year earlier, Mr. Sutter was the first science teacher at Wellston to emphasize climate science.
He happened to do so at a time when the mounting evidence of the toll that global warming is likely to take, and the Trump administration’s considerable efforts to discredit those findings, are drawing new attention to the classroom from both sides of the nation’s culture war.
Since March, the Heartland Institute, a think tank that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, has sent tens of thousands of science teachers a book of misinformation titled “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” in an effort to influence “the next generation of thought,” said Joseph Bast, the group’s chief executive.
The Alliance for Climate Education, which runs assemblies based on the consensus science for high schools across the country, received new funding from a donor who sees teenagers as the best means of reaching and influencing their parents.
Idaho, however, this year joined several other states that have declined to adopt new science standards that emphasize the role human activities play in climate change.
At Wellston, where most students live below the poverty line and the needle-strewn bike path that abuts the marching band’s practice field is known as “heroin highway,” climate change is not regarded as the most pressing issue.
And since most Wellston graduates typically do not go on to obtain a four-year college degree, this may be the only chance many of them have to study the impact of global warming.
But Mr. Sutter’s classroom shows how curriculum can sometimes influence culture on a subject that stands to have a more profound impact on today’s high schoolers than their parents.
“I thought it would be an easy A,” said Jacynda, 16, an outspoken Trump supporter.
“It wasn’t.”
Mr. Sutter, who grew up three hours north of Wellston in the largely Democratic city of Akron, applied for the job at Wellston High straight from a program to recruit science professionals into teaching, a kind of science-focused Teach for America.
He already had a graduate-level certificate in environmental science from the University of Akron and a private sector job assessing environmental risk for corporations.
But a series of personal crises that included his sister’s suicide, he said, had compelled him to look for a way to channel his knowledge to more meaningful use.
The fellowship gave him a degree in science education in exchange for a three-year commitment to teach in a high-needs Ohio school district.
Megan Sowers, the principal, had been looking for someone qualified to teach an Advanced Placement course, which could help improve her financially challenged school’s poor performance ranking.
She hired him on the spot.
But at a school where most teachers were raised in the same southeastern corner of Appalachian Ohio as their students, Mr. Sutter’s credentials themselves could raise hackles.
“He says, ‘I left a higher-paying job to come teach in an area like this,’” Jacynda recalled.
“We’re like, ‘What is that supposed to mean?”’ “He acts,” Gwen said with her patented eye roll, “like he’s God’s gift to Wellston.”
In truth, he was largely winging it.
Some 20 states, including a handful of red ones, have recently begun requiring students to learn that human activity is a major cause of climate change, but few, if any, have provided a road map for how to teach it, and most science teachers, according to one recent survey, spend at most two hours on the subject.
Chagrined to learn that none of his students could recall a school visit by a scientist, Mr. Sutter hosted several graduate students from nearby Ohio University.
On a field trip to a biology laboratory there, many of his students took their first ride on an escalator.
To illustrate why some scientists in the 1970s believed the world was cooling rather than warming (“So why should we believe them now?” students sometimes asked), he brought in a 1968 push-button phone and a 1980s Nintendo game cartridge.
“Our data and our ability to process it is just so much better now,” he said.
In the A.P. class, Mr. Sutter took an informal poll midway through: In all, 14 of 17 students said their parents thought he was, at best, wasting their time.
“My stepdad says they’re brainwashing me,” one said.
Jacynda’s father, for one, did not raise an eyebrow when his daughter stopped attending Mr. Sutter’s class for a period in the early winter.
A former coal miner who had endured two years of unemployment before taking a construction job, he declined a request to talk about it.
“I think it’s that it’s taken a lot from him,” Jacynda said.
“He sees it as the environmental people have taken his job.”
And having listened to Mr. Sutter reiterate the overwhelming agreement among scientists regarding humanity’s role in global warming in answer to another classmate’s questions — “What if we’re not the cause of it?
What if this is something that’s natural?” — Jacynda texted the classmate one night using an expletive to refer to Mr. Sutter’s teaching approach.
But even the staunchest climate-change skeptics could not ignore the dearth of snow days last winter, the cap to a year that turned out to be the warmest Earth has experienced since 1880, according to NASA.
The high mark eclipsed the record set just the year before, which had eclipsed the year before that.
In woods behind the school, where Mr. Sutter had his students scout out a nature trail, he showed them the preponderance of emerald ash borers, an invasive insect that, because of the warm weather, had not experienced the usual die-off that winter.
There was flooding, too: Once, more than 5.5 inches of rain fell in 48 hours.
The field trip to a local stream where the water runs neon orange also made an impression.
Mr. Sutter had the class collect water samples: The pH levels were as acidic as “the white vinegar you buy at a grocery store,” he told them.
And the drainage, they could see, was from the mine.
It was the realization that she had failed to grasp the damage done to her immediate environment, Jacynda said, that made her begin to pay more attention.
She did some reading.
She also began thinking that she might enjoy a job working for the Environmental Protection Agency — until she learned that, under Mr. Trump, the agency would undergo huge layoffs.
“O.K., I’m not going to lie.
I did a 180,” she said that afternoon in the library with Gwen, casting a guilty look at her friend.
“This is happening, and we have to fix it.”
After fleeing Mr. Sutter’s classroom that day, Gwen never returned, a pragmatic decision about which he has regrets.
“That’s one student I feel I failed a little bit,” he said.
As an alternative, Gwen took an online class for environmental science credit, which she does not recall ever mentioning climate change.
She and Jacynda had other things to talk about, like planning a bonfire after prom.
As they tried on dresses last month, Jacynda mentioned that others in their circle, including the boys they had invited to prom, believed the world was dangerously warming, and that humans were to blame.
By the last days of school, most of Mr. Sutter’s doubters, in fact, had come to that conclusion.
“I know,” Gwen said, pausing for a moment.
“Now help me zip this up.”
The chief executive of General Motors, an automaker synonymous with Detroit, saw the future of driving not in the Motor City but on the streets of San Francisco.Mary T. Barra, a G.M. lifer who had worked her way from engineer to the top, was in the back seat of a prototype self-driving electric car as it wound its way through the city’s downtown a year ago.
She wanted to see for herself whether automation was ready to take over from a driver — safely, and on a mass scale.
How would it react, for example, when it reached an intersection as a light turned yellow?
Driving in a situation like that, “you have to make a decision,” she recalled in a recent interview.
“Generally if you decide to go, you decide to speed up.
Or you stop.”
If the technology works, she said, it will make the right decision: “The car knows.”
After that drive, Ms. Barra made her own decision to speed up, convinced that such cars were worth betting the company on.
Within six months after what she called her “aha!
moment” in San Francisco, a fleet of self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, the company’s new electric car, was being built at a G.M. assembly plant in Michigan, the pace accelerated at the direction of Ms. Barra and her senior management team.
It was a first for any major car company, and the first leg of a race she is determined to win.
The question now is whether a company identified with the industry’s bygone glory days can be a trendsetter in 21st-century transportation — and beat out Silicon Valley rivals like Google, Tesla and Uber with no legacy business to encumber them.
“The auto industry is on the cusp of significant change, and G.M. has to prove that a longtime established player can be up to the task,” said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with the car-shopping site Autotrader, who has followed the company since the 1980s.
“If you look at their past performance, their record has been spotty at best.”
General Motors is making a big wager that it can succeed, shedding overseas operations while investing $600 million this year in self-driving cars and other advanced technologies.
It spent $1 billion on Cruise Automation, a Silicon Valley start-up that developed the driverless technology powering Ms. Barra’s ride in San Francisco.
It is a perilous challenge — balancing the demands of a global automotive business with an aggressive push into expensive high-tech models — that has already claimed victims.
Last month, Ford Motor ousted its chief executive, Mark Fields, aiming to send a signal that it could keep pace.
But G.M. is making a case that it can be a leader in the auto industry of both today and tomorrow.
“We are very, very serious and intent on putting something on the road,” Ms. Barra said of the company’s automated vehicles.
“We definitely want to be first.”
Like its rivals, G.M. has ridden the economic recovery and low gas prices to record demand and profits.
But it faces headwinds as sales flatten and new technologies increasingly cast a shadow over its traditional business.
Tesla, the electric-car upstart, is now valued more highly than any Detroit automaker.
In shaping its future, G.M. is betting on products that have yet to gain a foothold in the marketplace and could take years to develop fully.
It is doing so while enduring criticism from President Trump for building vehicles in Mexico and for laying off workers at home.
At the same time, Ms. Barra has built a closer relationship with Mr. Trump than other auto executives have, serving on his business advisory panel and taking the lead for the industry in talks on fuel-economy rules.
The company is also fending off a campaign by a dissident investor to create two classes of stock, aimed at increasing G.M.’s value to shareholders.
One class would pay a steady dividend, while the other would appreciate based on the company’s growth.
The fight will culminate on Tuesday at the annual shareholder meeting.
In a letter to investors last week, the hedge fund that floated the dual-class proposal, Greenlight Capital, called G.M.’s board — including Ms. Barra, its chairwoman — “uninspired” for opposing its proposal.
“After seven years of a flat stock price, how much longer must shareholders wait?” the letter said.
While she agrees the company is undervalued, Ms. Barra insists that G.M.’s performance will ultimately pay off in better returns.
“Does it frustrate me?” she said of the stock price.
“Yes, but I want to do the right things over the long term to improve the business.”
In beginning to assemble fully automated Bolts in January, G.M. was a step ahead of Google and Uber, which are converting mass-market minivans and sedans into driverless models.
It went beyond what Tesla has achieved with autonomous controls on its own models.
And it reflected the feverish competition underway.
“We don’t go in to compete,” Ms. Barra said.
“We don’t go in to have an entry.
With every new product we’re doing, we are going in to win.”
For Ms. Barra, 55, who took the helm at G.M. in 2014 as the first female chief executive of a major automaker, it is the latest chapter in the company’s long comeback.
Eight years ago, G.M. was so deeply debt-ridden and burdened by high costs and faltering brands that some thought it would be left for dead.
It was rescued through a government-engineered bankruptcy, only to find itself under fire over defective ignitions that were tied to 124 deaths.
Under Ms. Barra, the company weathered that crisis and is moving to become leaner and stronger.
It is selling off its money-losing European division and unwinding its operations in other international markets like Australia, India and Russia.
It has cut unprofitable sales of vehicles to rental fleets and reduced shifts and workers at some American factories that make slow-selling cars.
“G.M. used to constantly talk about where we were going to spend more money,” said Mark L. Reuss, the company’s executive vice president for product development.
“What we were doing was robbing our good businesses to fix the broken ones.”
As G.M. streamlines operations in the United States and elsewhere, it is redirecting energy and capital to its self-driving initiative.
“I do believe General Motors is a tech company,” Ms. Barra said.
“We put these products on the road that integrate 30,000 parts and have hundreds of millions of lines of code in them already.
And we have to make them durable and work in all environments.”
Its commitment is on display at a sprawling plant in Orion Township, Mich., about a 45-minute drive northwest of Detroit, where the company builds conventional subcompact cars as well as Bolts.
One area of the factory is dedicated to a small-scale assembly line where workers customize Bolts with self-driving equipment, including a large computer in the trunk and modules packed with sensors on the roof and fenders.
“We’re on the cutting edge here,” said Bill Rock, a 22-year G.M. veteran who works on the autonomous vehicle line.
“It’s a very complicated process, but it’s the direction the company needs to go.” G.M. has built about 140 autonomous Bolts to be used for testing in Arizona, California and Michigan by Cruise Automation, now a subsidiary.
Kyle Vogt, a founder of Cruise, said G.M. had given its engineers a distinct advantage by building a state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle, rather than retrofitting a conventional car.
“These vehicles coming off the assembly line have been built from the ground up,” he said.
“That’s a real car, and not a mash-up of off-the-shelf parts that need to be integrated into the system.”
Ms. Barra’s view of what G.M. can accomplish was forged in her years as one of its first female plant managers.
And she believes G.M. can lead the self-driving revolution without additional acquisitions or partners.
“We have everything we need,” she said.
Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a business professor at Yale and a leadership expert who has known most of Ms. Barra’s predecessors dating back decades, is convinced of her resolve.
“Mary is the right person at the right time, and she does it without an ounce of showmanship,” he said.
The challenge of autonomous vehicles is hardly her first test as chief executive.
Her baptism by fire came during the congressional hearings and government investigations surrounding the faulty ignition switch.
Ms. Barra methodically directed the company to fix the defective parts, revamp its safety procedures, compensate accident victims and their families and negotiate settlements and fines with regulators and the Justice Department.
She says the episode informed her approach to self-driving cars, which she believes herald a new era of road safety, and left her impatient for results.
And she says she is determined for G.M. to lead the technological revolution changing the industry.
“If anyone can,” she said, “why shouldn’t we be the ones to do it?”
Declaring “enough is enough,” Prime Minister Theresa May vowed on Sunday to conduct a sweeping review of Britain’s counterterrorism strategy after three knife-wielding assailants unleashed an assault late Saturday night, the third major terrorist attack in the country in three months.At least seven people were killed and dozens more wounded, including 21 who remained in critical condition, as the men sped across London Bridge in a white van, ramming numerous pedestrians before emerging with large hunting knives for a rampage in the capital’s Borough Market, a crowded nightspot.
In a matter of minutes, the three assailants were chased down by eight armed officers who fired about 50 rounds, killing the men, who wore what appeared to be suicide vests but subsequently proved to be fake.
One member of the public also sustained nonfatal gunshot wounds, the police said.
The assault came days before national elections this week and after the British government had downgraded the country’s threat level to “severe” from “critical,” meaning that an attack was highly likely, but not imminent.
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had been carried out by “a detachment of Islamic State fighters.”
Analysts said the Islamic State considers anyone whose actions were inspired by the group to essentially be a member.
“This is how ISIS decentralizes its terrorism,” said Laith Alkhouri, a director at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company in New York that tracks militant threats and cyberthreats.
“As of now, there’s no indication that ISIS orchestrated or directed these attacks.”
On Sunday morning, Mrs. May’s Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party announced that they were suspending campaigning for the parliamentary elections — for less than a full day, in the case of Labour — out of respect for the victims.
However, the right-wing, populist U.K. Independence Party said it would continue with its scheduled campaign events.
Mrs. May said the election would go ahead on Thursday as planned.
The prime minister led an emergency meeting of her security cabinet on Sunday morning.
In a statement afterward, she said the government would intensify its counterterrorism efforts to deal with Islamist radicalism at home and to try to restrict “the safe spaces it needs to breed,” both on the internet and in British communities.
“Everybody needs to go about their lives as they normally would,” she said.
“Our society should continue to function in accordance with our values.
But when it comes to taking on extremism and terrorism, things need to change.”
Mrs. May said that the government might extend the duration of custodial sentences for terrorism suspects, but that more needed to be done in binding communities together to combat what she called “a perversion of Islam,” adding, “There is, to be frank, far too much tolerance of extremism in our country.”
Mrs. May, who was home secretary for six years before becoming prime minister, has been pressing for a tougher line against Islamist extremism for some time.
By stating on Sunday that police and security measures were insufficient, she was announcing a new effort, if re-elected, to break down what she sees as self-segregated communities and to be less delicate in confronting them.
Legally, she has been stymied by the difficulty of finding a definition of extremism that would hold up in court when challenged on the grounds of free speech.
A good example of the challenge is the case of Anjem Choudary, who spent nearly two decades preaching jihad and radicalizing youths.
While some of his organizations were banned, Mr. Choudary, a lawyer, managed to avoid breaking the law while being credited with helping to recruit hundreds of British Muslims to fight for Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.
Mr. Choudary was convicted in 2016 of inviting support for a terrorist organization after film emerged of him pledging allegiance to the Islamic State’s self-styled caliphate.
He was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.
Mrs. May also called for a global effort to “regulate cyberspace,” something that is likely to prove difficult, and said the London attack was not connected to the suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester, England, last month that killed 22 people.
While none of the assailants in Saturday’s attack were identified, the counterterrorism police conducted a raid Sunday in Barking, in east London, and arrested 12 people — seven women and five men — ages 19 to 60.
The police said searches there continued, suggesting that they had identified at least one assailant.
Britain’s home secretary, Amber Rudd, said on Sunday that the government was confident the attackers were “radical Islamist terrorists.”
Speaking on ITV television, Ms. Rudd said, “As the prime minister said, we are confident about the fact that they were radical Islamist terrorists, the way they were inspired, and we need to find out more about where this radicalization came from.”
She refused to say whether the attackers had been known to the authorities before Saturday.
Ken Chigbo, a resident of the neighborhood on King’s Road in Barking where the apartment was raided, said he knew the man who lived in the apartment.
He said the neighbor lived with his wife and two young children, looked to be in his mid-20s and was known in the community by his nickname, “Abs.”
“He would always be in a religious gown to his shins, with tracksuit bottoms and trainers underneath,” Mr. Chigbo, 26, said about his neighbor, with whom he played table tennis.
“I trusted him.
We got on.”
Mr. Chigbo added that a group of three to four men would visit his neighbor’s apartment every week or so.
“They were always in religious robes and wearing red-and-white checkered scarves wrapped around their heads,” he said.
The man named Abs had expressed interest in a van that Mr. Chigbo rented recently for a move.
“He said, ‘Look, Ken, where did you get your van from, how much did you pay, do they do it in automatic?’”
Mr. Chigbo recalled.
“Then he said he and his family are thinking of moving too.”
With the general election days away, several polls have shown Mrs. May’s lead over Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to be narrowing.
Mr. Corbyn issued his own strong condemnation of the attacks.
“We are all shocked and horrified by the brutal attacks in London,” he said in a statement.
“My thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have died and the many who have been injured.
Today, we will all grieve for their loss.”
Using different methods, pollsters are divided about the extent of the Conservative lead, but they all show the gap with Labour shrinking, making the landslide Mrs. May hoped for unlikely and even, for at least one polling company, raising the possibility of a hung Parliament.
It is too early to say how the attack will affect the vote, if at all.
In general, crises tend to help the incumbent.
However, Mrs. May did not seem to receive much of a polling bounce after the Manchester attack, partly because of some campaign mistakes.
And as the former home secretary, she might receive some blame for perceived security failings.
Campaigning had already been suspended once, after the Manchester attack.
That happened while Mrs. May was on the defensive, having had to change the position on home care policy announced just days earlier in her party’s manifesto.
Mayor Sadiq Khan of London said that the police had been dispersed across the city and that security would remain heightened throughout the week.
Mr. Khan, who described the assault as a “deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners,” said that some of the injured were in critical condition, raising the possibility that the death toll would rise.
“We will never let these cowards win, and we will never be cowed by terrorism,” he said.
The Muslim Council of Britain also condemned the attack and praised the emergency services.
“Muslims everywhere are outraged and disgusted at these cowards who once again have destroyed the lives of our fellow Britons,” said the council’s secretary general, Harun Khan.
“That this should happen in this month of Ramadan, when many Muslims were praying and fasting, only goes to show that these people respect neither life nor faith.”
The attack hit a nation still recovering from the shock of the bombing in Manchester almost two weeks ago, when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the doors of an Ariana Grande concert.
Many of those killed were children, and 116 people were injured.
Ms. Grande returned to Manchester with a star-powered lineup on Sunday night to perform in a charity concert and pay tribute to the victims.
Saturday’s attack was reminiscent of another on Westminster Bridge on March 22, when Khalid Masood, 52, drove a car into pedestrians, killing four people.
He then stabbed a police officer to death before being shot and killed near Parliament.
The police treated that attack, in which 50 were injured, as “Islamist-related terrorism.”
The mood in London veered from shock to anger in the aftermath of Saturday’s attack.
Expressions of support poured in from Europe, the United States and beyond.
In a news media communiqué, President Emmanuel Macron of France expressed solidarity with the British people and described the attack as “horrendous and cowardly.”
“French citizens are among the victims,” he said.
“France is doing everything it can to provide them with assistance.”
As none of the victims were immediately identified, it was not clear if any were French.
In a statement, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said that a Canadian citizen was among those killed in the attack.
The premier of British Columbia, Christy Clark, confirmed the death of Chrissy Archibald, who was from the province.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said citizens of his nation, too, were among the injured.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said, “We are united beyond all borders in horror and sorrow, but also in determination.”
And President Trump said on Twitter: “Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the UK, we will be there — WE ARE WITH YOU.
GOD BLESS!”
But then the president took aim at “political correctness” and Mr. Khan.
“We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people,” he posted.
“If we don’t get smart it will only get worse.”
Mr. Trump then accused Mr. Khan, inaccurately, of saying there was nothing for Londoners to be concerned about.
“At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’” he wrote.
In fact, Mr. Khan wrote in a statement about the need to remain “calm and vigilant,” and was speaking about the enlarged police presence in the capital when he said there was no reason to be alarmed.
It has offices in a sleek Manhattan skyscraper.
Its bonds are accessible to millions of American investors.
And it holds ties to some of New York’s biggest banks.Despite this presence on Wall Street, detailed in previously unreported financial records, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, is no normal bank.
It is wholly owned by the Russian state.
It is intertwined with Russian intelligence.
And the Russian prime minister is, by law, the chairman of its supervisory board.
Now VEB is at the center of an international firestorm that threatens the Trump presidency because the bank’s chief — a prominent graduate of Russia’s spy school — met with Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, during the presidential transition.
That meeting is a focus of a federal counterintelligence investigation about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
Three years ago, in response to Moscow’s military intervention in Ukraine, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on VEB that have effectively kept it from taking on most new business in the United States.
Since then, however, VEB has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in the event that sanctions would be lifted, according to interviews with American bankers and former government officials.
That moment appeared to be nearing with Mr. Trump’s victory.
And so the bank’s chief, Sergey N. Gorkov, traveled to New York in December for what he described as a “roadshow” promoting the bank that was largely hinged on the prospect of improved diplomatic and business relationships between the United States and Russia.
During that trip, The New York Times has found, Mr. Gorkov met with bankers at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and another, unidentified American financial institution.
Goldman Sachs bankers also tried to arrange a meeting but ultimately had a scheduling conflict.
The meetings, which are not prohibited by sanctions, were confirmed by three people briefed on the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly about them.
None of the American banks were new to VEB.
Citi and JPMorgan had long, established relationships clearing financial transactions for VEB in the United States, activities not affected by the sanctions.
And before the sanctions, securities filings show, Goldman and others had helped the Russian bank issue bonds, activity that was blocked by the sanctions and that VEB was eager to resume.
After a few painful years, continuing Western borrowing had become a pressing priority for Moscow.
The Russian Finance Ministry has spent about $10 billion to prop up the bank over the past three years, according to banking analysts.
On that same trip, Mr. Gorkov met with Mr. Kushner.
The nature of the meeting, which remains in dispute, followed a session between Mr. Kushner and the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about opening a communications channel with Russian officials during the presidential transition, according to current and former American officials.
The F.B.I. and congressional investigators are now scrutinizing whether Mr. Kushner may have met with Mr. Gorkov to help establish a direct line to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, or for other reasons not cited by the White House.
The White House and VEB have issued contradictory statements about the purpose of the Gorkov meeting.
The White House has said that Mr. Kislyak requested the meeting and that “Mr.
Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official.”
But VEB said Mr. Gorkov had met with Mr. Kushner, who was still running his family’s real estate company, to discuss business.
The statement said VEB’s management had met with “a number of representatives of the largest banks and business circles of the U.S.,” a claim supported by the Times’s reporting about Mr. Gorkov’s meetings with banks in New York.
VEB has not disclosed specifics of the conversation with Mr. Kushner, which is of keen interest to investigators.
Mr. Kushner’s hunt for overseas investors for his company’s financially troubled Manhattan office tower on Fifth Avenue has been documented by The Times.
While such an investment would not fit the profile of VEB’s past lending, it would have been possible for Mr. Gorkov to relay such information to other Russian banks.
It is not known, however, whether the subject was raised in the meeting.
The subject of sanctions was also freshly topical in December.
The rolling back of sanctions was an essential part of Mr. Gorkov’s strategy in visiting New York, and was central to the health of his bank.
The next month, during Mr. Trump’s first week in office, administration officials signaled they were considering lifting the sanctions that stemmed from the conflict in Ukraine.
Separately, Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, had several phone conversations late last year with Mr. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador.
In one, the two men discussed additional sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in response to the Russian government’s efforts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.
The meeting with Mr. Kushner was not VEB’s only connection to Mr. Trump’s campaign or associates.
A banker who pleaded guilty last year to spying for Russia out of VEB’s office in New York was part of an unsuccessful Russian scheme to recruit Carter Page, an American businessman who later became a Trump campaign adviser, as a spy.
VEB also obtained shares in a Ukrainian steel smelter when it was sold by a business partner of Mr. Trump’s who built a Trump hotel in Toronto, according to previously undisclosed documents from the vast leak known as the Panama Papers.
The VEB involvement in the smelter deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
These interactions have stirred concerns over whether the bank, which few Americans have heard of despite its ties to Wall Street and big companies like Boeing, has been spreading Russian influence along with its financial footprint.
A representative for the bank would not comment.
VEB and Mr. Putin are inextricably linked.
The bank stepped up lending after 2008 when Mr. Putin, then prime minister, became chairman of the board.
And during the oil boom, VEB was seen as embodying Russia’s new financial might.
Under a 2007 law, VEB’s mandate was to lend to important but underfinanced sectors of the Russian economy, including infrastructure and businesses that help diversify the economy beyond oil dependence.
There are other government-controlled banks in Russia, Sberbank and VTB, but they are primarily retail banks.
VEB serves a very different role, lending mostly to large borrowers, many of them politically connected.
To that end, VEB over the last decade has lent freely in ways that dovetail with government priorities and make it a tool of Russian soft power.
The purse strings opened for two influential groups in particular: oligarchs building Olympic sites in Sochi and companies in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.
“This is not a bank,” said Karen Vartapetov, a public finance analyst at Standard & Poor’s.
“We should rather treat this bank as a government agency.
It is used by the government as a tool to invest in politically and socially important but not always financially viable projects.”
VEB’s role as a projector of state influence was on display in 2010 with a deal that potentially affected a Trump hotel in Toronto.
At the time, Alex Shnaider, a Russian-Canadian businessman developing the hotel, was looking to sell a steel plant in Ukraine.
His Midland Resources Holding Ltd., which owned the Zaporizhstal steel factory, sold at least half its stake to a collection of five offshore companies that received funding from VEB, according to documents in the trove of files from the law firm Mossack Fonseca that were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
The documents show that one year after acquiring the Zaporizhstal stake, the five companies — based in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands — transferred it to Russian control.
In each case, the companies’ shares were “charged in favor of” VEB, meaning the bank effectively took ownership of them in exchange for financing the steel plant acquisition.
Court papers in Canada show that Mr. Shnaider’s deal to sell the steel plant coincided with his need to cover cost overruns in the Trump deal.
His lawyer initially told The Wall Street Journal last month that about $15 million from the Ukraine sale went into the $500 million Toronto project, but he later backtracked.
Nothing in the Panama Papers linked VEB’s financing to the Trump project, which Mr. Trump did not own.
Rather, the deal underscored VEB’s strategy to venture into Ukraine at the behest of the Russian government.
More broadly, the bank’s plan had been to tap capital markets in New York to help finance the Ukraine lending, but the plan collapsed with the imposition of sanctions in 2014.
The bank today, not unlike Mr. Putin’s government, expanded its sway abroad in a way that appears unsustainable.
Weighed down by sanctions and the oil price collapse, the Russian economy has slipped to 12th in the world, below South Korea’s, according to a World Bank ranking.
At the time sanctions were imposed, the bank’s total debt ran about $20 billion.
It has since been reduced to $17 billion, according to financial disclosures at the end of last year.
But the Ukraine lending in particular is affecting the balance sheet, with outstanding Ukraine debt totaling $14.2 billion at the current exchange rate, banking analysts say.
Last week, the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reported that about 40 percent of VEB’s loans were at risk of default.
Mr. Gorkov, who previously worked at the Yukos oil company and was a senior executive at Sberbank, became director of VEB in February 2016, partly with a mandate to find market solutions to the bank’s financial woes.
For Mr. Gorkov, fixing VEB would require a new focus, and that, according to the bank’s statement, became the reason for a meeting with Mr. Kushner.
The two met as Mr. Gorkov traveled to gather ideas for a new strategy for the bank, published a month after the meeting with Mr. Kushner in a document called “Strategy 2021.”
It called for shifting some risks directly to the Russian budget, selling assets not considered central to the bank and trying to resume borrowing in places like the United States.
The document suggested that the bank was expecting some relief from sanctions.
“The forecasts for the term of the strategy predict certain decrease of geopolitical risks and gradual weakening of the restricted access to global capital markets,” it said.
Robert Amsterdam, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Gorkov’s former boss at Yukos, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, said it was essential that sanctions be lifted for the VEB turnaround to succeed.
“Putin doesn’t have to worry about what the voters think of him,” Mr. Amsterdam said.
“Putin has to think about the top 100.
And the top 100 are those who are sanctioned.”
Long before VEB became saddled with sanctions, it had deep ties to Washington and Wall Street.
In 2010, Mr. Gorkov’s predecessor appeared at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington to unveil a pact with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the federal agency that supports American exports.
Under the deal, the two institutions agreed “to cooperate in financing U.S. exports to Russia.”
The arrangement was followed by two little-noticed deals.
In 2013, the Export-Import Bank guaranteed a loan of about $500 million so that, in effect, a VEB subsidiary could acquire a number of Boeing 777 aircraft — planes that VEB then leased to Aeroflot Russian Airlines.
A year later, shortly before the sanctions hit, the American agency guaranteed another loan of about $700 million for a similar deal.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Export-Import Bank said, “These transactions all supported the sale of U.S. exports and thus supported American jobs.”
Since the sanctions took effect, the spokeswoman said, there have been no new VEB transactions, and deals involving any Russian entities have been placed on “administrative hold.”
The sanctions also limited VEB’s relationship with American banks.
The sanctions prohibit United States banks and companies from “transacting in, providing financing for or otherwise dealing” in new long-term debt.
For years, issuing debt was a good business for both Wall Street and VEB.
Between 2006 and 2013, Goldman, Citi and Morgan Stanley helped the Russian bank issue one bond deal after another, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Now, American banks can work for VEB only in more limited roles.
JPMorgan, Citi and BNY Mellon, for example, remain registered to clear VEB’s transactions through the United States, clearinghouse records show, though such transactions have waned since the sanctions were imposed.
Many major American banks and investment firms also continue to include VEB debt in mutual funds, including those of Fidelity and Pimco, securities filings show.
It would not be out of the ordinary, then, for a VEB official to have brief courtesy meetings with New York bankers about continuing business, though they would not be allowed to discuss new bond deals, said Aaron Wolfson, a partner at Lewis Baach who previously worked at JPMorgan and prosecuted banks for skirting sanctions.
Still, Zachary K. Goldman, a former Treasury Department official who worked on financial sanctions issues, said the banks needed to be cautious.
“Just because limited interactions with VEB may be legally permissible doesn’t mean that there aren’t reputational and other kinds of risks involved,” said Mr. Goldman, now the executive director of the Center on Law and Security at the New York University School of Law.
“The concern for me with this particular entity would be its reported ties to the Russian security services.”
Mr. Gorkov, 48, graduated in 1994 from the university of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B. — a school for spies.
Like many in his generation of security agents in the early post-Soviet period, he ventured into banking and the oil business.
In fact, say businessmen who have worked in Russia, so many F.S.B. agents are in the upper management of state-owned companies that the roles of spy and executive blend almost seamlessly.
“In Putin’s Russia, they don’t draw a distinction,” said Mr. Amsterdam, the lawyer who represented Mr. Gorkov’s former employer.
Highly educated and often speaking foreign languages, former F.S.B. officers include Mr. Putin himself, senior officials throughout his government, and board members and top executives at state-run corporations.
Mr. Gorkov’s biography on VEB’s website does not suggest he ever served in the F.S.B.
The bank did not respond to questions about whether he worked for the agency.
But the bank has been known to employ spies.
In 2015, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington announced charges against Evgeny Buryakov, an employee at VEB’s New York office, accusing him of acting as a covert agent of the S.V.R., the Russian foreign intelligence agency.
Mr. Buryakov, who was charged alongside two other Russian men accused of trying to recruit Mr. Page, later pleaded guilty, and VEB paid his legal bills.
At the time, the authorities suspected that some VEB managers were aware of Mr. Buryakov’s spy activities, according to a person briefed on the investigation.
Federal authorities recorded a conversation between the two co-defendants discussing how an S.V.R. official told Mr. Buryakov’s supervisor at VEB that Mr. Buryakov was an “employee of the service.”
China’s devastating pollution problems began here, in coal country, where legions of workers toiled and often died to exhume the rich deposits that fueled the country’s sooty rise to economic power.Today, these muddy plains are home to a potent symbol of China’s new ambition: to bypass the United States and cement its dominant role in clean energy.
On a lake created by the collapse of abandoned coal mines, China has built the world’s largest floating solar project, enough to provide light and air conditioning to much of a nearby city.
The provincial government wants to expand the effort to more than a dozen sites, which collectively would produce the same amount of power as a full-size commercial nuclear reactor.
The project reflects China’s effort to reshape the world order in renewable energy as the United States retreats.
Such technological expertise will form the infrastructure backbone needed for countries to meet their climate goals, making China the energy partner of choice for many nations.
The wave-proof solar panels are an affordable and viable option for power-hungry countries.
Delegations from Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore and elsewhere have come to study the project while the maker, Sungrow, prepares to license the technology for overseas sale.
China is capitalizing on the leadership vacuum left after President Trump said last week that he would pull the United States out of the Paris accord to limit climate change.
China has already started an expensive campaign at home and abroad to solidify its considerable hold on solar, wind and other energy-saving businesses.
If successful, China would win the economic and diplomatic spoils that the United States and some European countries have long enjoyed from dominating businesses like software, computer chips and airplanes.
China’s sway will be on display in Beijing this week at the Clean Energy Ministerial, a gathering of top energy officials from two dozen countries and the European Union that represent producers of three-quarters of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
While the United States will be there, its representatives reflect the country’s deep split.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry, an enthusiastic supporter of fossil fuel industries, will attend, along with Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a vocal supporter of renewable energy.
China is an unlikely champion in fighting climate change.
The country is the world’s largest polluter, and its problems could grow as people buy more cars and use more power.
It remains deeply dependent on coal, an especially dirty source of power.
And the race in renewables hasn’t been won.
The United States and European Union accuse Beijing of unfairly subsidizing its green industries and have raised trade barriers against Chinese-made goods.
American companies and local governments are set to continue their clean-energy push despite Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris accord.
As with much in China, the clean-energy drive is much more about economic advantage, national security and political stability than an idealistic commitment to saving the earth.
The country’s “Made in China 2025” program, the heart of Beijing’s domestic industrial policy, calls for heavy spending on clean-energy research and development, as a way to bolster the economy.
State-owned banks are pouring tens of billions of dollars each year into technologies like solar and wind along with energy conservation strategies like high-speed rail and subway lines.
China’s “One Belt, One Road” plan — a $1 trillion global offensive by President Xi Jinping to nurture economic and diplomatic ties through infrastructure building — is poised to bankroll clean-energy projects across Asia, including the Mideast; East Africa; and Eastern Europe.
The projects give China an edge, pushing countries to buy from Chinese companies.
China is already dominant in many low-carbon energy technologies.
It produces two-thirds of the world’s solar panels and nearly half of the wind turbines.
China is also rapidly expanding its fleet of nuclear reactors and leads the world by far in hydroelectric power.
“It’s different from traditional energy, which is dominated by Western countries,” said Li Tao, the technical director at JA Solar, the Chinese supplier of Sungrow’s panels.
“China has an opportunity to surpass Western countries in new energy.”
Choking pollution problems and worries that rising ocean levels could devastate coastal cities forced Beijing a decade ago to begin a campaign to find green solutions.
Local governments provided land for nearly free, and state-owned banks handed out enormous loans at very low interest rates.
Sometimes government agencies helped companies repay their loans.
Coal is getting far less attention.
While China is still building some coal-fired power plants, it has canceled plans for others.
Many existing ones are running well below capacity.
“Coal is over,” said Li Junfeng, a longtime renewable-energy official at the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning agency.
“Every year, it will be gradually reduced, city by city.”
China’s green campaign is still in the early stages.
The solar industry employs more than one million workers in everything from making panels for export to installing them domestically, though solar accounts for only 2 percent of its electricity needs.
By contrast, China has four million coal miners to supply the power plants that generate 70 percent of the country’s electricity.
But the clean-energy effort is already transforming coal country.
For decades, Yang Xuancheng, a former coal miner in Liulong, here in Anhui Province in east-central China, toiled for 12-hour days in sweltering heat.
A natural gas explosion killed half his 20-member drilling team.
When mines emptied of coal began collapsing underground, the land subsided and his boyhood village disappeared into a 25-foot-deep hole.
The hole soon filled with rainwater and groundwater, creating a mile-wide lake.
The lake is now the home of Sungrow’s floating solar power project.
Mr. Yang, 57, wires together the plastic tubes that carry the connective wiring for the panels.
“This aboveground work is so much more pleasant than the hot air down in a coal mine,” Mr. Yang said.
Such solar efforts have put China at the leading edge of renewables.
The United States and Japan invented many of the key technologies for solar panels over the past half century.
But they were more cautious about building very large factories, fearing they would have to cut prices below cost to sell all the panels.
Extremely cheap Chinese panels have driven dozens of Western companies out of business, including several more in recent months.
Chinese players like JinkoSolar and Trina Solar, the world’s biggest makers of solar panels, invested heavily in production.
Their highly automated plants churn out vast numbers of panels with consistent quality at ever-falling cost.
GCL Group, a large manufacturer in Suzhou, now relies on robots for much of its production, from melting the raw materials for the silicon to assembling the final equipment.
The company has nearly doubled production in the past four years even while cutting its work force nearly in half.
“If you don’t have the factories as a manufacturing base, then new ideas and technical innovation will stay in the air and not amount to anything,” said Lu Jinbiao, an executive vice president at GCL.
That technical know-how is helping Chinese companies capture sales in some of the world’s fastest-growing solar panel markets, like India and Saudi Arabia.
China is tailoring the technology for developing markets that will need innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their climate goals.
JA Solar is redesigning some panels for very hot, dry deserts and others for very humid jungles.
Doing so will make them cheaper to manufacture than a module created to withstand extreme heat and extreme humidity.
The panels at the lake in Liulong are made to be waterproof.
Xiao Fuqin, the chief engineer at Sungrow’s floating solar panel project, said delegations arrive almost daily from around China and across Asia to examine the nitty-gritty specifications, like how to lay large power cables underwater to connect many panels.
“This technology shows that China is keeping the leading role in solar, as it has for many years,” Mr. Xiao said.
“We have been the pioneers, and pushed our industry another small step forward.”
The Islamic State’s grip on Mosul has shrunk to a tighter circle of neighborhoods in the western part of the city.
But many civilians are still trapped in those areas, and the militants are giving no ground easily.As we traveled with Iraqi forces through the Rifai neighborhood last month, evidence of a brutal street fight was all around.
The destruction was immense, and it seemed not a single house was free of bullet holes — or worse.
While clashes still raged in the last remaining pockets of Islamic State control in Rifai, displaced people began to trickle out at dusk.
The number of people managing to flee appeared much lower than in earlier parts of the battle for the west.
Other than the occasional group of hushed and worn-out people who would suddenly file out from the front line, the streets were almost devoid of a human presence.
Another exception was the Iraqi forces stationed there.
But yet there are many civilians in the area, most sticking to their houses out of fear of crossfire, or of being seized by Islamic State fighters.
On one street corner, opposite an Iraqi special forces base near the front line, five dead Islamic State fighters lay rotting in the summer heat — a rare concentration of militants, who have increasingly fought in smaller teams of two or three men.
Some Iraqi soldiers said the fighters had probably been caught by cannon fire from a helicopter or plane.
The bodies were bloated and covered in the flies that seem to flourish in the debris-strewn streets of Mosul.
Special forces soldiers took up defensive positions on the edge of Rifai after it was recaptured, and they waited for their next orders.
Then came the Islamic State’s counterattack.
Under the cover of a sudden sandstorm, the jihadists fought the troops for hours before being driven off.
The militants seldom seem to pass up the chance to use storms or other heavy weather, when coalition aircraft can’t target them, to press the fight.
On the front line the next morning, soldiers told how the intense gunfire during the storm battle had set their sandbag walls on fire.
They appeared amazed that the Islamic State remained well equipped and capable, and described how the militants were disciplined about using vehicles and medics to retrieve their wounded.
On May 29, a Monday morning, four battalions of Iraqi special forces soldiers moved into what seemed to be a very small part of the western district of Al Saha to try to clear it of any remaining Islamic State fighters.
Setting out early, the men split into teams and moved into the area in stages.
The second team had time to rest and eat breakfast before being called to join the operation.
The work for Iraqi troops has already been grueling as they have tried to clear neighborhoods north of the Old City, often within gunshot of militants holed up there.
Al Saha is one of the close-in areas, and the Iraqi special forces there took care to use the rat holes that the militants had cut through the walls of homes in order to move more securely.
At one junction on the edge of Rifai, an Islamic State sniper had taken up position and was shooting at vehicles as they crossed the road.
He fired at a large group of fleeing civilians, narrowly missing.
His shot flew over their heads and hit an upturned car behind them.
The gunfire split the crowd, with half running back to where they had come from.
There was no other way for them to get to safety, so they waited for a military vehicle to cross the road and used the dust it kicked up as cover to make a run for it.
Women carrying children, family members carrying the infirm — all moved as quickly as they could to reach safety.
Somehow, they made it out unhurt.
Little has been left unscathed in these neighborhoods, where a tremendous amount of firepower from the sky and on the ground has been brought to bear.
Coalition airstrikes are still being called in frequently in the middle of densely populated neighborhoods, and the civilian toll has been immense.
But the Iraqi forces have seemed reluctant to advance at all without the air support.
Here, they treated a girl who was wounded when her house was hit in an airstrike.
When asked why the men didn’t just engage the Islamic State fighters more directly themselves rather than risk more civilian lives by using airstrikes, one young soldier said they wanted to finish the fight with no casualties on their side.
Maybe this way of thinking points to the high rate of attrition the Iraqi forces have had over the last few years of fighting the militants, including a huge toll on the elite counterterrorism forces over the past few months of urban fighting in Mosul.
Or maybe it’s an indication of a fight so bitter that utter destruction is acceptable as long as the enemy is beaten.
Ahead lies Mosul’s Old City, and perhaps the worst fight yet.
As the battle has drawn closer to that area’s tight and jagged streets, the number of fleeing civilians has dropped sharply.
Some of the soldiers here, as well as one resident who had managed to flee, spoke of the Islamic State fighters’ trying to round up anyone still living in the area and forcing them to retreat with them toward the Old City.
It’s a chilling thought, horrifyingly consistent with how the Islamic State has fought this battle for months.
The militants’ last stand may well take place behind a wall of civilians.
For years, the tiny, energy-rich country of Qatar has carved out a niche in the Arab world by trying to be everything to everyone.
It housed an American military base and flooded the region’s airwaves with its influential media, all while keeping close ties to Iran and a wide selection of Islamist movements.On Monday, five countries in the region announced that they were forcing Qatar to choose: Its powerful neighbor Saudi Arabia, Egypt and at least three other Arab nations severed all ties with the country, escalating their accusations that the Qatari monarchy supported Sunni Islamist terrorism and Iranian designs on the region.
Those Arab nations not only abruptly suspended diplomatic relations, as they have in the past, but also surprised many by cutting off land, air and sea travel to and from Qatar.
All but Egypt, which has 250,000 people working there, ordered their citizens to leave Qatar.
The move created an immediate crisis for Qatar, whose only land border is with Saudi Arabia and which imports about 40 percent of its food from the Saudis.
Residents said that people were stocking up on food and cash.
And Qatari diplomats and citizens were scrambling to meet a 48-hour deadline to leave some Persian Gulf countries where they had been posted.
Some analysts saw the sudden escalation as a sign that Saudi Arabia and its allies had been emboldened by the recent visit from President Trump, in which he publicly embraced the Saudis as a leading partner in fighting terrorism and countering Iran’s influence.
In that view, Mr. Trump, by strongly embracing the Saudis, pulled the gloves off a brawl that had long threatened to turn ugly.
But it could also end up hurting American efforts to build broader coalitions in the region, and weaken an ally that has provided a vital base for the American military in its campaign against the Islamic State.
Randa Slim, at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said the move raised questions about whether the Trump administration knew what it was unleashing when it further empowered the Saudis.
“Regionally, the decks are stacked against Qatar: If denied U.S. support, the Qatari emir has no option but to back down,” Ms. Slim said.
“The question is what, if anything, will this administration do about it?”
Signaling concern, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson offered to broker the impasse on Monday.
“We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences,” Mr. Tillerson said.
The move was announced by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bahrain and Yemen.
The Maldives and the eastern government in divided Libya also said they were joining in the sanctions.
But in a sign that some Saudi allies were still on the fence, neither Jordan nor Kuwait joined in.
Air traffic was immediately disrupted, with the United Arab Emirates suspending service to Qatar by its three carriers, Etihad Airways, Emirates and FlyDubai, beginning Tuesday morning.
Qatar Airways was banned from Saudi airspace.
The Foreign Ministry of Qatar released a statement saying the action had “no basis in fact” and was “unjustified.”
The Iranian government criticized the Saudi-led action in a diplomatically worded rebuke.
“Neighbors are permanent; geography can’t be changed,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on his Twitter account.
“Coercion is never the solution,” Mr. Zarif said.
“Dialogue is imperative, especially during blessed Ramadan.”
Qatar, one of the richest countries in the world, has used that wealth in recent years to play an outsize role in regional politics.
It has often sought to cast itself as a broker, trying to mediate the region’s intractable conflicts.
But just as often, it has ended up angering all sides.
Its actions are a study in contradictions.
Qatar has good relations with Iran, but hosts the American air base.
It is helping to fight the Iranian-linked Houthi rebels in Yemen, and it is backing insurgents fighting Tehran’s ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.
Yet it has also established back channels to Iran and brokered deals with it.
Tensions had been building for years.
There was Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which challenged the established order in Egypt before being suppressed by the current government.
Qatar also has supported Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip and is a rival of the Palestinian Authority.
And the broadcasts of the Pan-Arab news network Al Jazeera, which Qatar funds, have long ruffled feathers across the Middle East.
Qatar’s rivals have also faulted it for condoning fund-raising for militant Islamist groups fighting in Syria — including groups tied to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State — although several of the other Sunni-led monarchies in the region have played similar roles.
Qatar’s opponents have added a third allegation to those grievances: that it is conspiring with their regional rival, Iran.
That is in part because Qatar has taken an important back-channel role with Iran to defuse points of contention in the Syrian war.
It has repeatedly brokered hostage and prisoner exchanges, paying millions of dollars to insurgent and militant groups in the deals.
The most notable of those deals came in April, when Qatar paid a huge ransom to free 26 members of a Qatari falcon-hunting party, including members of the royal family, who had been taken hostage by Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq.
Officials said Qatar paid millions of dollars, most of which was said to have gone to militia leaders loyal to Iran.
Qatar is also a sponsor of the Four Towns agreement in Syria, negotiated with Iran and Hezbollah, in which civilians trapped under siege by government troops or by rebel forces have been bused to other areas.
The deals are hailed by some as the only way to rescue civilians, but they have been criticized by others as forced displacements.
The Qataris complain that they are being targeted.
They say they were the victims of a cyberattack last month when the state news media outlet released a false report quoting the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, as referring to tension with Washington over Iran policy and saying that Mr. Trump might not be in power for long.
The F.B.I. was investigating and has not yet released its findings.
But one analyst, Gerd Nonneman, a professor of international relations and gulf studies at Georgetown University’s campus in Doha, Qatar, said F.B.I. and British intelligence officials had “no doubt” that the article on the emir was the result of a hack.
“This is the first time we’ve seen this level of cyberattack in the gulf, the hacking of a news site,” Mr. Nonneman said.
“We’ve not seen these countries engage in these types of online attacks before, at least against each other.
It is new ground for them.”
The isolation of Qatar was widely being taken as a clear message from Saudi Arabia that in the new order, no softness on Iran or on the Muslim Brotherhood would be tolerated.
But even though Saudi anger at the Qataris has brewed for a long time, on several fronts, some analysts believe Mr. Trump’s visit provided a moment to act.
“It is entirely possible that the catalyst to this crisis was the feeling in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi that the U.S. under the Trump administration is aligned with them,” said Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said the new moves reflected a “bullishness” prompted by the Trump administration’s stances — on the confrontation with Iran and on a willingness to look the other way on human rights violations.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are getting “no U.S. pushback” on human rights or on the Yemen intervention, he said, while “Egypt also feels off the hook with Trump, and is using the opportunity to repair ties with the Saudis, reinforce with the Emiratis and be more assertive in Libya.”
But the move carries perils for the other countries as well, Mr. Sayigh warned.
“Cutting relations with Qatar suggests a worrying readiness to be assertive and belligerent,” he said, adding that it “may prove to be a case of overreach.”
But the escalating confrontation between Qatar and other Sunni-led Arab states presents a new and unwelcome complication for the United States military, which has made strenuous efforts to forge a broad coalition against the Islamic State.
Mr. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who appeared in their first joint news conference, in Sydney, Australia, after talks with their Australian counterparts on Monday, insisted that it would not undermine the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“I am confident there will be no implications,” Mr. Mattis said.
But there were few immediate answers to some difficult questions for American operations.
How, for example, can the American-led air campaign include warplanes from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates if those governments will no longer allow their military representatives to be based at, or even to visit, a major United States command center?
Beyond the military difficulties, several multinational corporations have operations in the feuding nations.
A Saudi call for companies to withdraw from Qatar could present international executives with difficult choices about where to do business.
Qatar is hosting the 2022 World Cup, for instance, and is building facilities for the tournament that are part of an ambitious construction boom, including creating branches of international universities.
About 80 percent of Qatar’s residents are foreign workers, including white-collar professionals and construction and service workers.
There are about 250,000 Egyptians working in Qatar, which is perhaps why Cairo did not call for its citizens to leave as Saudi Arabia did.
President Trump has excellent lawyers.
They have a challenging client.In a series of Twitter posts Monday that continued into the evening, Mr. Trump may have irretrievably undermined his lawyers’ efforts to persuade the Supreme Court to reinstate his executive order limiting travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, according to legal experts.
Saying he preferred “the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version” he had issued in March, Mr. Trump attacked both the Justice Department and the federal courts.
He also contradicted his own aides, who have suggested he was causing a pause in travel, by calling the order “what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!”
He said it would be imposed on “certain DANGEROUS countries” and suggested that anything short of a ban “won’t help us protect our people!”
There is a reason lawyers generally insist that their clients remain quiet while their cases move forward, said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston.
“Talkative clients pose distinct difficulties for attorneys, as statements outside the court can frustrate strategies inside the court,” Professor Blackman said.
“These difficulties are amplified exponentially when the client is the president of the United States, and he continuously sabotages his lawyers, who are struggling to defend his policies in an already hostile arena.
I do not envy the solicitor general’s office.”
Even a lawyer with strong ties to the administration said Mr. Trump was hurting his chances in the Supreme Court and undercutting the work of the Justice Department’s elite appellate unit.
George T. Conway III, who withdrew last week as Mr. Trump’s nominee for assistant attorney general for the civil division and whose wife, Kellyanne Conway, is the president’s counselor, commented on one of Mr. Trump’s posts.
“These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won’t help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters,” he wrote in his own Twitter post, referring to the Office of the Solicitor General and the Supreme Court of the United States.
“Sad.”
Still, some administration supporters said the court should not consider the tweets.
While looking beyond the letter of the order might be appropriate in domestic policy, the president has a freer hand in foreign policy, said David B. Rivkin Jr., a lawyer in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
“As a constitutional matter, as a legal matter, it should make absolutely no difference,” he said of the president’s extracurricular messaging.
Last week, lawyers in the solicitor general’s office filed polished briefs in the Supreme Court.
They urged the justices to ignore incendiary statements from Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, including a call for a “Muslim ban.”
The court should focus instead on the text of the revised executive order and statements from Mr. Trump after he had taken the inaugural oath to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution,” the briefs said.
Mr. Trump, his lawyers said, was now a changed man, alert to the burdens and responsibilities of his office.
“Taking that oath marks a profound transition from private life to the nation’s highest public office, and manifests the singular responsibility and independent authority to protect the welfare of the nation that the Constitution reposes in the president,” they wrote.
On Twitter early Monday, though, Mr. Trump appeared to say that the latest executive order was of a piece with the earlier one, issued in January, and with his longstanding positions.
In calling the revised order “politically correct,” Mr. Trump suggested that his goal throughout had been to exclude travelers based on religion.
And in calling the revised order “watered down,” he made it harder for his lawyers to argue that it was a clean break from the earlier one, which had mentioned religion.
The Supreme Court has asked people and groups challenging the executive order to file their responses to the government’s briefs next Monday.
Those responses will almost certainly rely on Mr. Trump’s tweets in arguing that the justices should not revive the order.
The court will probably act on the government’s requests in the coming weeks.
In his posts, Mr. Trump seemed to betray a misunderstanding of how two branches of the federal government work.
His criticism of the Justice Department was misplaced, because it works for him.
He could have insisted that it defend his original order.
It was Mr. Trump’s decision, too, to issue the revised order.
Mr. Trump also suggested that the Justice Department could ask the Supreme Court to impose a “much tougher version” of his executive order.
But the court’s role is limited to evaluating the lawfulness of the current order.
Insulting judges is also generally a poor litigation strategy.
But Mr. Trump also posted that “the courts are slow and political!”
Mr. Trump’s adversaries certainly welcomed his tweets.
“It just adds to the mountain of already existing evidence that the government has had to ask the court over and over to ignore,” said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people and groups challenging the law.
“Blinding the courts to a reality that everyone else is aware of is never an attractive position, but is especially problematic when you have to ignore in real time what’s being said by the president of the United States.”
Neal K. Katyal, who represents Hawaii in a separate challenge to the order, said there was a yawning gap between Mr. Trump’s tweets and his lawyers’ filings.
“The president’s statements, before, during and after his inauguration, continually demonstrate what his so-called travel ban is really about,” Mr. Katyal said.
“It’s not surprising his story and his tweets don’t match up with what the solicitor general has been trying to say in court.”
There was also daylight between the president and his aides about what to call the executive order.
“People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!” Mr. Trump wrote.
But his own staff members had insisted it was not a travel ban.
Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, spent much of one early briefing telling reporters not to call it that.
“It’s not a travel ban,” Mr. Spicer insisted.
“When we use words like travel ban, that misrepresents what it is.”
At the time, John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, also rejected the phrase.
“This is not a travel ban,” he said.
“This is a temporary pause that allows us to better review the existing refugee and visa vetting system.”
Mr. Trump’s posts came as Ms. Conway went on NBC’s “Today” show and chastised the news media for focusing too much on the president’s Twitter feed, calling it an “obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.”
The revised executive order, which the president criticized on Monday, took Iraq off the list of countries that would be affected and made clear that the restrictions did not apply to those who held green cards or valid visas.
It also eliminated a provision that seemed to prioritize Christian refugees for entry.
The revised order, like the first, barred all refugees from entering the country for 120 days.
It limited entry for 90 days for visitors from six countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
“In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe,” Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.
The administration said it chose those six nations and Iraq from a list of “countries of concern” identified in a law signed by President Barack Obama in 2015.
But experts have said that since the Sept. 11 attacks, no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from any of those nations.
This was not the first time the president had expressed second thoughts about revising the original order.
In March, after a Federal District Court in Hawaii blocked the revised version, Mr. Trump complained that it was only “a watered-down version of the first order” and told a rally of supporters that “I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way” to the Supreme Court, “which is what I wanted to do in the first place.”
Britain on Monday identified two of the three suspects in the weekend’s terrorist assault in London, including one who not only was well-known to the police but had a cameo in a television documentary on homegrown violent jihadists.The identifications immediately suggested that the police and intelligence services had missed a series of red flags in failing to stop the attack, which left seven people dead and dozens wounded in a nation still grappling with the Manchester concert bombing two weeks earlier.
The terrorist attack on Saturday was the third to strike Britain in three months, all with the participation of radicalized British Muslims who had been on the radar of law enforcement but still plotted successfully.
The frequency of the attacks has created the impression of a sudden campaign against Britain hatched from within.
But counterterrorism officials and others say the country has been a terrorist target for years.
Even now, there are hundreds of investigations underway.
What is not publicized, they say, is how many attacks are prevented in the plotting phases.
“What’s got through is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Shiraz Maher, deputy director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization, at King’s College London.
“And it’s an enormous iceberg.”
Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said after the attack on Westminster Bridge on March 22 that at least 13 plots had been broken up since 2013.
Police and security officials say at least five others have been thwarted since then.
Recent examples, according to the police, include foiled conspiracies to crush American soldiers with a van at an air base in southeast England, a drive-by shooting in West London by two men on a moped, and a Remembrance Day knife assault.
The three successful attacks reflect what counterterrorism experts call the reality that plots are underway all the time.
And some contend that the number of radicalized individuals has become increasingly unmanageable, taking into account those who have returned from fighting in Syria and those frustrated that they cannot travel there.
The suspects in the most recent attack — Rachid Redouane, 30, and Khurum Shazad Butt, 27, along with a third assailant — plowed through London Bridge pedestrians in a van Saturday night, then stabbed patrons at bars and restaurants in nearby Borough Market.
All three were shot dead by police officers.
Police officials said Mr. Butt had been known to them and to MI5, Britain’s domestic intelligence agency.
More questions were raised Monday when footage resurfaced of a Channel 4 documentary broadcast last year, titled “The Jihadis Next Door,” in which Mr. Butt is seen among a group of men unveiling an Islamic State flag in London’s Regent’s Park.
Britain had been largely free of terrorism for years.
Before March, the last major attack was in 2005, when suicide bombers coordinated an assault on London’s public transit system, killing 52.
In 2013, two British-born converts to Islam, of Nigerian descent, butchered Lee Rigby, a British soldier, in daylight on the streets of London.
Yet compared with Belgium, France and Germany, where terrorism has become more common, Britain was seemingly spared.
It was not for lack of trying on the part of militants.
“Terrorist groups have wanted to strike the United Kingdom for a long time, and they’ve been very persistent in their effort,” said Raffaello Pantucci, a terrorism specialist at the London-based Royal United Services Institute.
Still, the pace appears to have intensified during an election campaign that has placed Britain in the international spotlight, multiplying the publicity of any attack.
As in France, where a police officer was killed on the Champs-Élysées before the presidential election in April, the attack on Saturday happened five days before Britons go to the polls.
“It’s political.
It’s about trying to disrupt our democratic process,” said Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for the northwest area of England.
Islamists in Britain have been distributing leaflets urging people not to vote, he said, adding, “They don’t believe in democracy.”
Beyond that is terrorism’s tendency to propagate itself.
Successful attacks sometimes inspire copycat acts or are designed to unfold in waves.
Two weeks after the attacks in London in 2005, for example, two militants attempted similar assaults, but their bombs failed.
With terrorists resorting to everyday items like kitchen knives or vehicles as weapons, copycats have become an even more serious concern, Mr. Maher of King’s College London said.
“The way terrorism operates is that when a plot succeeds, it then motivates like-minded other people to get involved themselves,” he said.
“People who are sympathetic, people who think, ‘If he could do it, I can do it.’”
“Right now, we’re in a particularly acute phase where three events have got through within a three-month period, and unlike in 2005, people aren’t having to consider making sophisticated bombs with multiple actors,” said Mr. Maher, the author of a new book called “Salafi-Jihadism.”
“It’s as simple as: Get a car and mow somebody down.”
Comparisons have been made between the attack on Saturday and the one on March 22, when a Briton, Khalid Masood, plowed a car into civilians on Westminster Bridge and fatally stabbed a police officer outside Parliament before he was shot dead.
About a month later, a man carrying a backpack full of knives was arrested near Prime Minister Theresa May’s residence on suspicion of planning a stabbing.
The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has long encouraged this type of crude attack.
Two months ago, the group’s propaganda wing exhorted supporters to use fake bomb vests, knives and trucks to kill “crusaders” during the holy month of Ramadan.
The British authorities have released few details about the plots they have disrupted in recent years.
In 2013, Mr. Pantucci said, a group of men believed to have returned from fighting in Syria planned to commit a mass shooting but were arrested.
Another scheme involved one of the most notorious British plotters and recruiters, Junaid Hussain, a computer hacker from Birmingham, England, who was prosecuted in 2012 and convicted on charges that he had illegally gained access to former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s address book the year before.
In 2015, Mr. Hussain recruited a young delivery van driver from Luton and directed him in the foiled plot to attack American soldiers at an air base.
“You troll around online, you find people who are radicalized, you connect with them, and then you instigate them to do a plot,” Mr. Pantucci said.
“He walked them through actually doing the operation, and then you hope that they actually go and do it.”
Mr. Hussain was killed in a drone strike in Syria in 2015, after the British intelligence services discovered his involvement in recruiting people for several major plots that year.
Also in 2015, two university students were caught planning a drive-by attack on a police station and army barracks in West London.
The pair — Tarik Hassane, who once wanted to be a heart surgeon, and his friend Suhaib Majeed, a physics major — were arrested after a surveillance team observed them buying a semiautomatic pistol with a silencer and bullets.
Another man, Nadir Syed of West London, was arrested in November 2014, suspected of planning a knife attack at Remembrance Day celebrations that month.
In many ways, Britain has a good record in preventing radicalization and terrorism.
Despite an infamous statistic that more British Muslims have joined the Islamic State in Syria than have joined the British Army, the per capita count of those defecting to Syria is lower than in countries like Belgium and France, experts say.
A police program for detecting radicalization, called Prevent, has a toxic reputation in Muslim communities in Britain but is considered exemplary by other European countries.
Still, the security services are stretched.
There are about 500 principal investigations of active plotters, 3,000 further people of interest on the radar and more than 20,000 others with vague links to militancy, and resources to keep tabs on suspects are limited.
“It’s a very big threat picture,” Mr. Pantucci said.
The victory was so sweet that the head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent thank-you notes to his employees.Nearly four decades in the making, a new rule under the Obama administration was set to lower workplace exposure to beryllium, an industrial mineral linked to a lung disease that is to estimated to kill 100 people annually.
And the nation’s largest beryllium producer had agreed to back the new restrictions.
“Once we finish, these workers will be protected and we will end the epidemic of beryllium exposure in the United States,” David Michaels, the OSHA chief, said at the time in 2015.
But several weeks ago, just as the rule was going into effect, the safety agency suddenly proposed changes that experts expect may exempt major industries from the tougher standard.
It was one of several instances in which workplace safety decisions have been revisited in the early months of the Trump administration.
OSHA has also put off enforcement of an Obama-era standard for another respiratory hazard — silica, a mineral linked to a disabling lung disease as well as cancer — and it has delayed action on a rule that would require employers to electronically report workplace injuries so that they can be posted for the public.
The moves come as the Trump administration offers other hints of a significant relaxation in the government’s approach to occupational safety.
A successor to Mr. Michaels at OSHA has yet to be named.
Mr. Trump’s proposed budget eliminates at least two other strategies designed to promote worker safety, including the Chemical Safety Board, which investigates chemical plant accidents, and an OSHA grant program that provides training in industries with high injury or fatality rates and workers who do not speak English well.
During the early months of the Trump administration, a former lobbyist for an industry group that has opposed the beryllium, silica and record-keeping rules served on the transition team at the Department of Labor, which oversees OSHA.
That official, Geoffrey Burr, who has since moved to the Department of Transportation as chief of staff, had been a lobbyist for the Associated Builders and Contractors, which represents nonunion construction companies.
A spokesperson for the Transportation Department declined to make Mr. Burr available for an interview but said that the former lobbyist had been in regular contact with officials while at the Department of Labor “to ensure he was in compliance with all ethics rules.”
The Associated Builders and Contractors did not respond to questions about Mr. Burr.
Asked about the Trump administration’s approach to occupational safety, a spokesman for the White House said, “The President and his administration care very much about worker safety, but believe the Obama administration’s approach was counterproductive, and we think we can do better.”
He added that decisions to repeal and reduce specific OSHA regulations had not been made.
OSHA did not respond to questions about specific regulations.
Business groups that have fought OSHA actions have welcomed the apparent new direction and others believe it heralds a different approach by the Trump administration.
“The agency, under Obama, changed into something that was more explicitly allied with unions and critics of business,” said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.
“That’s likely to change.”
Some workplace experts and advocates say the Obama administration’s decision to wait until the 11th hour to finalize some major rules made them vulnerable.
“Because they did it so late in the game, they left the rules open to change,” said Dr. Lee S. Newman, a pulmonary expert at the University of Colorado, who helped uncover worker deaths caused by beryllium.
Experts like Dr. Newman also fear that a widespread regulatory rollback is beginning, and possible changes to the beryllium rule are particularly frustrating to them because it had taken so long to get the new standards in place.
It has been known for decades that exposure at even very low doses to beryllium — a strong, lightweight metal used to make computers, aircraft parts and nuclear bombs — can cause chronic beryllium disease, a disabling and potentially fatal lung ailment, in a small percentage of workers with a genetic susceptibility to it.
The Obama-era standard resulted from negotiations between the biggest American producer of beryllium, Materion Corporation, and the United Steelworkers union.
At one time, Materion, which was once known as Brush Wellman, played down beryllium’s risks and fought efforts to lower federal exposure standards because of fears that doing so would undercut its defense of lawsuits brought by sick or dying workers, court filings showed.
When OSHA proposed its final rule in August 2015, Materion applauded it, calling it a demonstration of how “industry and labor can collaborate to better protect workers” and saying it could be a guide for how the agency could develop future standards.
But in April, less than three months into the Trump administration, OSHA sent proposed changes to the White House for review.
Agency officials declined to discuss the proposal.
But safety advocates and an industry lawyer involved in meetings with OSHA about the new rule said that it was made clear to them that OSHA intended to lessen the rule’s effect on maritime and construction companies — or perhaps even exempt them.
“I had the feeling that the administration has already decided what it wants to do,” said Peg Seminario, the director for safety and health for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Maritime and construction companies were not included in the original proposed rule in 2015, but the agency soon expanded the standard to include them because of data showing the potential dangers of coal slag, a gritty, glass-like material containing trace levels of beryllium that is used to sandblast ships, tanks and other structures before painting, according to Mr. Michaels, the former OSHA administrator who is now at the George Washington University School of Public Health.
Data cited by the agency, Mr. Michaels said, found that air levels of beryllium detected during sandblasting at shipyards exceeded the new proposed OSHA limit.
Some big shipbuilders supported the rule’s extension to their industry, and said they were moving away from coal slag toward other abrasives like glass and garnet.
“We have a sophisticated work force and they understand some of these dangers,” said Dru Branche, the environmental, health and safety director for Newport News Shipbuilding, which is owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries.
Before the new beryllium rule was finalized during the final weeks of the Obama administration, sellers of coal slag, many of them small companies, had voiced opposition to it, arguing, among other things, that OSHA’s position on the material’s dangers was misleading and that other abrasives posed their own risks.
Since President Trump’s inauguration, they have become far more aggressive, spending at least $60,000 to lobby OSHA through an industry group called the Abrasive Blasting Manufacturers Alliance, public records show, and enlisting two former congressmen to fight for them.
The group’s listed address in Camp Hill, Pa., is also the headquarters of the country’s largest vendor of coal slag, Harsco Corporation, a publicly traded company.
Requests for comment were referred by Harsco to a public relations agency, Dezenhall Resources, which declined interview requests but issued a statement.
“There’s a growing consensus that the beryllium rule was erroneously expanded to include the entire abrasive blasting industry without any evidence to justify it,” it said.
Materion, the big beryllium producer, has also objected to some parts of the final rule and is in negotiations with OSHA about those issues.
Groups like the Associated Builders and Contractors have said in filings that they were not given adequate opportunity to provide input on the rule, a position that Mr. Michaels, the former OSHA head, rejected.
Several former workers sickened by the metal say they oppose any effort to roll back the Obama rule.
One of them, Vishwanauth Jailall, worked for about six years at a facility in Minnesota pouring molten metals including beryllium into casts for airplane parts.
By 2012, he was having such trouble breathing that he went to see a doctor who told him that it was dangerous for him to go back to work.
Today, at 49, he needs help from family members to get dressed and is prone to passing out.
He wants a lung transplant, which, he said, is his best hope.
The government “shouldn’t weaken the standard; they should make it stronger,” Mr. Jailall said.
“I don’t want anyone else to get sick.”
The process of enacting a new OSHA standard is often a long and arduous one, regardless of which party holds power.
And companies or others frequently sue the agency, contending that it failed to follow procedures when drafting a rule or is imposing costs on employers that will yield little worker benefit.
The long-running dispute over silica followed that trajectory.
The mineral, which is found in sand and rocks, can be released during activities such as construction, sandblasting and fracking and is a known respiratory hazard.
OSHA first considered taking action on silica in the 1990s, but it was not until 2013 that the agency issued a proposed final rule, saying that reduced workplace exposures mandated by it would save some 700 lives annually.
That standard was finalized last year, but industry groups including the Associated Builders and Contractors have filed a lawsuit to block it.
The group said in a March letter to the Department of Labor that the rule was “infeasible and unworkable.”
A month later, OSHA announced it was delaying the rule’s enforcement for the construction industry until September to, among other things, “conduct additional outreach to the regulated community.”
In moving to eliminate the Chemical Safety Board, with an annual budget of about $11 million, the Trump administration’s budget proposal said the board was “largely duplicative” of efforts by other agencies, though the budget documents did not elaborate.
In arguing for the board’s continued existence, its chairwoman, Vanessa Allen Sutherland, said last month that it played an important and unmatched role.
For example, after 13 firefighters died responding to an explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant in 2013, the board determined that emergency workers nationwide were ill-prepared for such accidents and created a training program.
The day after President Trump asked James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, to end an investigation into his former national security adviser, Mr. Comey confronted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and said he did not want to be left alone again with the president, according to current and former law enforcement officials.Mr.
Comey believed Mr. Sessions should protect the F.B.I. from White House influence, the officials said, and pulled him aside after a meeting in February to tell him that private interactions between the F.B.I. director and the president were inappropriate.
But Mr. Sessions could not guarantee that the president would not try to talk to Mr. Comey alone again, the officials said.
Mr. Comey did not reveal, however, what had so unnerved him about his Oval Office meeting with the president: Mr. Trump’s request that the F.B.I. director end the investigation into the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who had just been fired.
By the time Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last month, Mr. Comey had disclosed the meeting to a few of his closest advisers but nobody at the Justice Department, according to the officials, who did not want to be identified discussing Mr. Comey’s interactions with Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions.
Mr. Comey will be the center of attention on Thursday during testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he is expected to be quizzed intensely about his interactions with Mr. Trump and why he decided to keep secret the president’s request to end the Flynn investigation.
His unwillingness to be alone with the president reflected how deeply Mr. Comey distrusted Mr. Trump, who Mr. Comey believed was trying to undermine the F.B.I.’s independence as it conducted a highly sensitive investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, the officials said.
By comparison, Mr. Comey met alone at least twice with President Barack Obama.
A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment on Mr. Comey’s request.
A Justice Department spokesman, Ian Prior, said, “The attorney general doesn’t believe it’s appropriate to respond to media inquiries on matters that may be related to ongoing investigations.”
The Justice Department typically walls off the White House from criminal investigations to avoid even the appearance of political meddling in law enforcement.
But Mr. Trump has repeatedly injected himself in law enforcement matters, and never more dramatically than in his private meetings with Mr. Comey.
“You have the president of the United States talking to the director of the F.B.I., not just about any criminal investigation, but one involving his presidential campaign,” said Matthew S. Axelrod, who served in senior Justice Department roles during the Obama administration and is now a partner at the law firm Linklaters.
“That is such a sharp departure from all the past traditions and rules of the road.”
But that raises one of the questions Mr. Comey will have to answer in his testimony on Thursday.
If he believed that Mr. Trump was trying to get him to end an investigation, why did he not tell anyone about it?
Mr. Trump’s defenders note that Andrew G. McCabe, the acting director of the F.B.I., has said that “there has been no effort to impede our investigation.”
Current and former law enforcement officials say Mr. Comey kept his interactions with Mr. Trump a secret in part because he was not sure whom at the Justice Department he could trust.
F.B.I. officials were also unsure whether what Mr. Trump had done was a crime or how the conversation could be corroborated.
So Mr. Comey kept the circle of officials at the F.B.I. who knew about his interactions with Mr. Trump small because he did not want agents and analysts working on the case to be influenced by what the president wanted.
Mr. Comey’s decision to keep his interactions with Mr. Trump a secret from the Justice Department were the latest example of how he set himself apart from the department throughout his tenure as F.B.I. director.
Several times during the F.B.I.’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s personal email server last year, for example, Mr. Comey made decisions without the Justice Department’s knowledge or approval, often to the consternation of Loretta Lynch, then the attorney general.
Mr. Comey has said he made those decisions — which have been praised and criticized along partisan lines — to protect the F.B.I.’s independence.
“In a legal sense, we’re not independent of the Department of Justice,” Mr. Comey told Congress last month.
“We are spiritually, culturally pretty independent group, and that’s the way you would want it.”
Mr. Comey is also likely to be asked Thursday what he told Mr. Trump about the Russia investigation.
Mr. Trump has told aides and said publicly that, on three occasions, Mr. Comey assured him he was not under investigation.
Current and former law enforcement officials said that when the investigation was handed over last month to a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, Mr. Trump was not a target.
But it is not clear what, if anything, Mr. Comey told the president about whether he was being investigated.
While Justice Department policy allows officials to tell people whether they are the target of an investigation, prosecutors — not F.B.I. agents — handle such discussions.
“We typically do not answer that question,” Mr. McCabe testified recently.
Former officials say Mr. Comey anticipated that the president might ask whether he was being investigated, and consulted his advisers on how to delicately sidestep the question.
The officials were not aware of how Mr. Comey decided to answer.
When the Justice Department transferred the Russia investigation to Mr. Mueller, it gave him the authority to investigate whether the president broke any laws by trying to obstruct the case or by firing Mr. Comey.
As F.B.I. director, Mr. Comey wrote a detailed memo after every major phone call or meeting with Mr. Trump and left the memos in the bureau’s files when he left.
As special counsel, Mr. Mueller has access to those memos, but the F.B.I. declined a request from the Senate Intelligence Committee for copies, citing the ongoing investigation.
It is unclear whether Mr. Comey still has copies of all of them or plans to read from them during his testimony.
According to people briefed on the memos, they describe not only what Mr. Trump said, but also details such as his tone and where he was sitting.
In one memo, Mr. Comey described a dinner with Mr. Trump at the White House a week after the inauguration in January.
Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to pledge his loyalty, but Mr. Comey refused.
Two weeks later, on Feb. 14, Mr. Trump kicked Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Sessions and other senior administration officials out of the Oval Office so he could have his one-on-one conversation with Mr. Comey, according to people briefed on one of Mr. Comey’s memos.
It was in that conversation that Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to end the investigation into Mr. Flynn and encouraged him to investigate leaks, the people said.
“I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey, according to the memo Mr. Comey wrote describing that meeting.
“He is a good guy.
I hope you can let this go.”
Asked Tuesday about Mr. Comey’s coming testimony, Mr. Trump replied, “I wish him luck.”
Islamic State propaganda had been found in the bag of one attacker while he was trying to board a flight in Italy.
An F.B.I. informant said he had raised alarms about the second attacker two years ago.
The third attacker, denied asylum in Britain, appeared to have sneaked in from Ireland.The warning signs about the three assailants in a white van who smashed and stabbed their way through a trendy London neighborhood tumbled into the open on Tuesday, compounding the pressure on the police and Prime Minister Theresa May to explain them.
What has become clear since the Saturday night assault is that again and again, the young men who killed seven people before they were shot to death by the police had been reported to law enforcement authorities, bumping into what should have been the country’s security net, only for those signals to be played down, ignored or missed.
The latest revelations have placed Mrs. May, a former home secretary who was in charge of counterterrorism for six years before taking over as prime minister last year, under intense scrutiny two days before a general election.
Even her own foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, a former London mayor, voiced the question many here are asking.
“How on earth could we have let this guy or possibly more through the net — what happened?” he asked in an interview on Sky News.
Some of the missed warnings were especially glaring because they came from the very people the British government had entrusted with identifying extremists.
Usama Hasan, a former Islamic extremist who now works with the police to help de-radicalize others, said he had a physical altercation in a London park less than a year ago with one of the assailants, Khuram Shazad Butt.
Mr. Butt’s brother, Saad, who did paid work for the police on counterextremism issues and was estranged from the assailant, missed signs of how dangerous his brother’s extremism had become.
Other warnings had also been raised about Mr. Butt, 27, who held odd jobs, including at KFC and a six-month stint as a customer service trainee for the London subway system that ended in October.
His second child was born weeks before the attack,  neighbors said.
In 2015, an F.B.I. informant, Jesse Morton, wrote a report to his handler in the United States, identifying Mr. Butt as a person to watch because of what Mr. Morton described as his rising role in extremist chat rooms run by Al Muhajiroun, an organization banned in Britain because of its sprawling links to terrorism.
“My handler got back to me and said it was ‘excellent work’ and forwarded it to the head office,” said Mr. Morton, a former Qaeda recruiter from New York who served prison time on terrorism charges before recanting and agreeing to work undercover for law enforcement.
Mr. Morton, who recently started Parallel Networks, an organization combating extremism, said it was unclear to him whether his F.B.I. report had been forwarded to British officials.
A spokesman for the F.B.I., Andrew C. Ames, said the agency had no comment.
Even excluding the F.B.I. report, plenty of alarms were ringing for the British authorities about Mr. Butt.
Neighbors and friends noticed his behavior, including a mother of three who lived in the same apartment building as Mr. Butt in Barking, a suburb in eastern London.
The mother, Erica Gasparri, was quoted by The Guardian as saying she confronted Mr. Butt two years ago after he tried to convert her son to Islam.
When she found him in a local park, she recalled, Mr. Butt said he was ready to do “in the name of Allah what needs to be done, including killing my own mother.”
Ms. Gasparri said she had called a police hotline and passed on photographs she had taken of him, but never got a call back.
At the KFC where he worked in Barking, employees were on edge after a video surfaced of Mr. Butt alongside other Muhajiroun members sparring with the police, who were called to a London park where the men had unfurled an Islamic State flag, said Ishtiaq Ahmed, whose brother worked at the same restaurant.
That video clip was also featured in a Channel 4 television documentary broadcast last year, “The Jihadis Next Door,” about extremists living in Britain.
Meanwhile, in Italy, the authorities allowed the second attacker, Youssef Zaghba, to walk past them last year at an airport security check, even though he was carrying Islamic State propaganda.
Mr. Zaghba, 22, an Italian of Moroccan descent, was en route to Syria to fight for the Islamic State when he was stopped in March at the airport in Bologna.
He was traveling on a one-way ticket, and the authorities found Islamic State material on one of his electronic devices, said two former European intelligence officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.
Giuseppe Amato, the chief prosecutor in Bologna, told a different account to Radio 24 in Italy, saying that Mr. Zaghba had been stopped en route to Istanbul because he was carrying nothing more than a knapsack, which raised suspicion.
“He told the security guard, who checked him — and then he corrected himself — that he was going to be a terrorist,” Mr. Amato said.
Mr. Zaghba was arrested and his belongings were confiscated, but after a judge charged with verifying the accusations against him found there were no grounds to hold him, they were returned, “so the contents on his device” were not examined, Mr. Amato said.
Still, Mr. Amato said that Mr. Zaghba had been singled out as a “suspicious person” to the British authorities.
“We did everything we could do,” he said.
“But there was no proof he was a terrorist.”
Free to move around in Italy, Mr. Zaghba tapped into that country’s little-known Muhajiroun network, said a retired senior European law enforcement official who was keeping tabs on the investigation.
While the dates are unclear, the official said the Italy-based network appeared to have introduced Mr. Zaghba to Mr. Butt.
Al Muhajiroun has been described as perhaps Europe’s most effective jihadist recruitment machine.
An estimated one-third of European Muslims who have joined the Islamic State, or ISIS, in Syria in recent years were influenced by the network of groups spawned by Al Muhajiroun and one of its founders, Anjem Choudary, a lawyer turned radical preacher.
In Britain alone, at least half of all terrorism cases have publicly documented links to Mr. Choudary, including the 2005 London transit bombings and the killing of a British soldier, Lee Rigby.
“Muhajiroun has significantly been involved in preparing and recruiting for ISIS,” said Rashad Ali, a resident senior fellow of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based research group that focuses on countering extremism.
Al Mahajiroun has haunted and taunted British security services for two decades.
Co-founded in 1996 by Mr. Choudary and another radical cleric, Omar Bakri, the group was banned in 2004.
But splinter groups promoting the same ideology kept resurfacing under different names until Mr. Choudary was convicted of promoting the Islamic State and jailed in 2016.
The third attacker, identified as Rachid Redouane, 30, was denied asylum in Britain in 2009, according to news reports, and moved instead to Ireland, where he married, worked as a pastry chef and lived for a time in Dublin.
He apparently managed to sneak into Britain through the porous Irish border to join the other attackers.
Of all the warning signs about Mr. Butt, the most detailed account was offered in an interview on Tuesday with Mr. Hasan, the member of the AVE network of former extremists and the head of Islamic studies at the Quilliam foundation.
Last July 6, Mr. Hasan said, he ran into Mr. Butt at a Muslim family fair in East London.
He was standing beside a fairground ride that his 9-year-old son had just mounted, when Mr. Butt, wearing a traditional Muslim robe and headdress, assailed him with abuse.
“You take money from the government to work against Muslims.
You spy on Muslims,” he raged.
“You are a murtadd,” an epithet used by the Islamic State.
Then he tried to charge Mr. Hasan.
“He ran straight for me with his face contorted in hatred,” Mr. Hasan recalled.
A fight ensued with multiple people, including Mr. Butt’s wife, dressed in a face-covering veil.
Mr. Hasan reported the episode to the police, emailing them photos of Mr. Butt that one of his family members had taken on a cellphone.
He told them Mr. Butt had displayed all the outward signs of a radicalized political Islamist he knew so well from his own past in radical circles and more recent de-radicalization work: the combination of a pious Islamic dress and long unkempt beard with the angry demeanor and the rehearsed lines.
“I told them I was certain these guys were Al Muhajiroun,” Mr. Hasan said.
“I said they are a national security threat.
They need to be monitored.”
The police constable on duty assured him that his concerns had been passed on to the Metropolitan Police’s counterterrorism unit, SO15, Mr. Hasan recalled.
Six months later, in January, Mr. Hasan said, he received a phone call.
The police had identified Mr. Butt, but no charges were brought.
“I am sure this man will sooner or later be arrested in some terrorism plot,” he recalled telling students in May at a lecture at Cambridge University.
On Tuesday morning, after having seen photographs of Mr. Butt in the news media, Mr. Hasan emailed the constable who had dealt with his assault case.
“Could you please confirm that my assailant in the above case (CAD 7943 06JUL16) is the same Khuram Butt who was one of the London Bridge terrorists over the weekend?” he wrote.
Fighting over a yellow cab is a long-enshrined tradition on the streets of New York City.Who hasn’t heard arguments erupt over who got there first or who needs the cab more?
As words turn into shoving matches or even fistfights, the outcome is inevitably the same: The winner rides away in the back seat, leaving the loser seething at the curb.
But instead of fighting, how about this jarring idea: sharing.
A new service gives passengers in thousands of yellow taxis the option of making space in the back seat for a stranger, in return for discounted fares.
The shared rides are being offered through an unusual partnership between two competing ride-hailing apps: Via, which runs car pools in parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, and Curb, an alternative to sticking out an arm to hail a cab.
The service is the latest effort to help the city’s troubled yellow taxi industry, which has steadily lost ground to the extraordinary growth of black cars dispatched by Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing apps.
It is intended to give New Yorkers another option for getting around at a time when the subway system has been overwhelmed by crowds and delays, and to create a more efficient transportation network with fewer cars driving around empty or clogging streets.
In doing so, it will also redirect passengers who have defected to the ride-hailing apps for convenience and cost back to the yellow cabs they left behind.
Yellow cabs made an average of 332,075 trips per day in March 2017, down from 393,886 the year before, according to the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates the industry.
“I think New Yorkers may be more willing to share than we give them credit for, especially if the price is right,” said Daniel Ramot, one of Via’s founders and its chief executive.
The shared taxis are currently operating in Manhattan.
The service will eventually include green taxis, which operate in northern Manhattan and in the city’s four boroughs.
Passengers can opt for a shared taxi through the existing Via or Curb app, and each party will pay 60 percent of the metered fare for the shared portion of his or her ride.
There will be a limit of two different parties — totaling three people — at a time in a yellow cab.
“It’s not a bad idea,” said Raul Perez, 28, an engineer.
“It’s a way to meet people.
You might even meet the love of your life in a taxi.
You never know.”
Mr. Perez recalled that he had shared a taxi with a tourist from Sweden six months ago because they both happened to be in Midtown heading up to Harlem.
The tourist talked so much about Sweden during the 20-minute ride that Mr. Perez said he is now interested in visiting.
But Samuel Cohn, 44, a store manager, said he would never share a taxi with someone he did not know.
“There are a lot of crazy people out there, and I don’t know who it is,” he said.
“Never trust anyone.”
The move to share cabs is not as new to New York as it might seem.
There have been other initiatives, but they were limited and did not really catch on.
For instance, in 2010, the city designated stands for group rides in yellow taxis at La Guardia Airport and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and on the Upper East Side for those going to Lower Manhattan.
A group ride service was also started in parts of Brooklyn and Queens when bus service was reduced.
The new service involves 7,000 yellow cabs, or just over half of the city’s fleet.
“This is an area where we believe the private sector can excel in ways that have eluded our own best efforts, and we are pleased to see this new option available to the riding public,” said Meera Joshi, the commissioner of the taxi and limousine agency.
In recent years, ride-hailing apps have conditioned more people to the idea of sharing.
Via, which started in 2013 with car pools on the Upper East Side, has grown to about 600,000 registered users in New York who pay a flat fee of as little as $5 to ride in a sport utility vehicle.
Uber also has its own version of a car pool, called UberPool, while Lyft has Lyft Line.
Another app, Bandwagon, has been offering shared rides in yellow taxis since 2015 to travelers at the city’s airports, Pennsylvania Station, and the Port Authority.
It has about 100,000 users and is working to expand its service.
Hadas Fischer, 32, a graduate student who has taken UberPool, said that while she would prefer riding by herself for privacy and comfort, she was willing to share a seat to save money.
“I wouldn’t talk to them,” she added.
“You are with strangers, but you don’t have to interact with them — that’s New York.”
The new service is voluntary for drivers, who do not pay anything extra to participate and stand to earn more from longer metered rides.
Samuel Pekoh, 62, of the Bronx, said he hoped it would “open the door for us to have more passengers.”
He picks up about 25 people in a 12-hour shift, he said, down from 43 people just five years ago.
Mr. Pekoh said that he has seen passengers willingly slide over for another passenger.
But then there was that time when he pulled up beside a man and a woman in the Wall Street area.
The man offered to share the taxi.
The woman said no, she wanted it to herself.
The man then jumped into the taxi and left her behind.
“I was laughing behind the wheel, and that’s not the first time,” Mr. Pekoh said.
“People are capable of sharing rides, but at the same time you will have New Yorkers who will say, ‘No, no.’”
A police officer shot and wounded an assailant armed with a hammer and kitchen knives on the square outside Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on Tuesday afternoon, according to the authorities.The cathedral, a Gothic landmark on the Île de la Cité in the Seine, across from the headquarters of the Paris police prefecture, was sealed off, and about 900 visitors and worshipers were told not to leave until the situation was declared safe.
The square was evacuated.
Gérard Collomb, the French interior minister, told reporters that the attack occurred around 4:20 p.m. when the man approached three police officers from behind and started hitting one of them with a hammer.
“This is for Syria,” the assailant yelled.
At least one officer opened fire, injuring the attacker, who was hospitalized.
The attacker was carrying an identity card describing him as an Algerian student, Mr. Collomb said, adding that investigators still needed to verify his identity, as well as his motivations.
He appeared to be acting alone.
“One sees that we have gone from a very sophisticated terrorism to a terrorism where, in the end, any tool can be used to carry out attacks,” Mr. Collomb said.
Karine Dalle, a spokeswoman for the Paris archdiocese, said in a text message that the roughly 900 people in the cathedral were notified about the violence and were “sitting calmly” until they were permitted to leave.
Two auxiliary bishops were also present, Ms. Dalle said, and reassured the crowd.
There were no signs of panic.
A witness in Notre-Dame reported on Twitter that visitors and worshipers were safe.
Three major terrorist attacks in France, in January 2015, November  2015 and July 2016, claimed more than 230 lives, and the country remains under a state of emergency.
Landmarks across France, the world’s most-visited country, are considered especially vulnerable, despite constant policing.
In September, a group of women suspected of plotting a terrorist attack were arrested after a car filled with gas canisters was found near Notre-Dame.
In February, a 29-year-old man armed with two large knives and shouting “God is great” in Arabic lunged at a military patrol near an entrance to the Louvre in Paris and wounded a soldier.
The assailant was shot by another soldier.
In March, a gunman was killed at Orly Airport, south of Paris, after attacking a soldier.
In April, days before the first round of France’s presidential elections, an attacker opened fire on a police van on the Champs-Élysées, killing one officer and wounding two others.
Officers opened fire, killing that attacker.
The attack outside the cathedral came just days before crucial legislative elections, the first round of which will take place on Sunday.
President Emmanuel Macron has announced he will create a special task force to coordinate the fight against terrorism better.
Speaking to the newspaper Le Parisien this week, Mr. Collomb, the interior minister, said that terrorist threats were “extremely high” in Europe and that security forces in France were more vigilant than ever.
In San Francisco’s public schools, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, is giving middle school principals $100,000 “innovation grants” and encouraging them to behave more like start-up founders and less like bureaucrats.In Maryland, Texas, Virginia and other states, Netflix’s chief, Reed Hastings, is championing a popular math-teaching program where Netflix-like algorithms determine which lessons students see.
And in more than 100 schools nationwide, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief, is testing one of his latest big ideas: software that puts children in charge of their own learning, recasting their teachers as facilitators and mentors.
In the space of just a few years, technology giants have begun remaking the very nature of schooling on a vast scale, using some of the same techniques that have made their companies linchpins of the American economy.
Through their philanthropy, they are influencing the subjects that schools teach, the classroom tools that teachers choose and fundamental approaches to learning.
The involvement by some of the wealthiest and most influential titans of the 21st century amounts to a singular experiment in education, with millions of students serving as de facto beta testers for their ideas.
Some tech leaders believe that applying an engineering mind-set can improve just about any system, and that their business acumen qualifies them to rethink American education.
“They are experimenting collectively and individually in what kinds of models can produce better results,” said Emmett D. Carson, chief executive of Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which manages donor funds for Mr. Hastings, Mr. Zuckerberg and others.
“Given the changes in innovation that are underway with artificial intelligence and automation, we need to try everything we can to find which pathways work.”
But the philanthropic efforts are taking hold so rapidly that there has been little public scrutiny.
Tech companies and their founders have been rolling out programs in America’s public schools with relatively few checks and balances, The New York Times found in interviews with more than 100 company executives, government officials, school administrators, researchers, teachers, parents and students.
“They have the power to change policy, but no corresponding check on that power,” said Megan Tompkins-Stange, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.
“It does subvert the democratic process.”
Furthermore, there is only limited research into whether the tech giants’ programs have actually improved students’ educational results.
One of the broadest philanthropic initiatives directly benefits the tech industry.
Code.org, a major nonprofit group financed with more than $60 million from Silicon Valley luminaries and their companies, has the stated goal of getting every public school in the United States to teach computer science.
Its argument is twofold: Students would benefit from these classes, and companies need more programmers.
Together with Microsoft and other partners, Code.org has barnstormed the country, pushing states to change education laws and fund computer science courses.
It has also helped more than 120 districts to introduce such curriculums, the group said, and has facilitated training workshops for more than 57,000 teachers.
And Code.org’s free coding programs, called Hour of Code, have become wildly popular, drawing more than 100 million students worldwide.
Mr. Hastings of Netflix and other tech executives rejected the idea that they wielded significant influence in education.
The mere fact that classroom internet access has improved, Mr. Hastings said, has had a much greater impact in schools than anything tech philanthropists have done.
“In our society as a democracy, I think it is healthy that there is a debate about what are the goals of public education,” Mr. Hastings added.
Captains of American industry have long used their private wealth to remake public education, with lasting and not always beneficial results.
What is different today is that some technology giants have begun pitching their ideas directly to students, teachers and parents — using social media to rally people behind their ideas.
Some companies also cultivate teachers to spread the word about their products.
Such strategies help companies and philanthropists alike influence public schools far more quickly than in the past, by creating legions of supporters who can sway legislators and education officials.
Another difference: Some tech moguls are taking a hands-on role in nearly every step of the education supply chain by financing campaigns to alter policy, building learning apps to advance their aims and subsidizing teacher training.
This end-to-end influence represents an “almost monopolistic approach to education reform,” said Larry Cuban, an emeritus professor of education at Stanford University.
“That is starkly different to earlier generations of philanthropists.”
These efforts coincide with a larger Silicon Valley push to sell computers and software to American schools, a lucrative market projected to reach $21 billion by 2020.
Already, more than half of the primary- and secondary-school students in the United States use Google services like Gmail in school.
But many parents and educators said in interviews that they were unaware of the Silicon Valley personalities and money influencing their schools.
Among them was Rafranz Davis, executive director of professional and digital learning at Lufkin Independent School District, a public school system in Lufkin, Tex., where students regularly use DreamBox Learning, the math program that Mr. Hastings subsidized, and have tried Code.org’s
coding lessons.
“We should be asking a lot more questions about who is behind the curtain,” Ms. Davis said.
Mr. Benioff, the billionaire behind Salesforce, had a blunt message for San Francisco’s mayor and its schools superintendent.
It was 2013, and the two city officials had approached Mr. Benioff hoping to persuade him to pony up a few million dollars to install Wi-Fi in schools and buy some classroom laptops.
But the request seemed too penny-ante to the software mogul.
“That’s when I had to say, ‘You guys need to think bigger!’”
Mr. Benioff recalled in an interview in his San Francisco home.
He urged the superintendent to imagine “what nirvana would look like” in his schools, if money were no object.
With that conversation, Mr. Benioff set in motion a transformation of the relationship between philanthropist and public education.
He has emerged as a kind of personal venture capitalist to the city’s public schools — one intent on remaking a traditional school bureaucracy in Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial image.
Mr. Benioff ultimately pledged $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company’s nonprofit arm, Salesforce.org.
Unlike conventional benefactors, he is hands-on: School district administrators now submit an annual grant wish list to the Salesforce.org board for review.
And Mr. Benioff dispenses not just money, but also management prescriptions.
“He’s almost a public-sector V.C.,” said Richard A. Carranza, who was then the superintendent of San Francisco schools.
Mr. Benioff rejected the notion that his approach to education philanthropy was venture-capitalist-like. “We are not giving them a new religion,” Mr. Benioff said.
“We are trying to work with them in a smart way and augment what they are doing.”
The partnership with the district kicked off in 2012 when San Francisco’s mayor, Edwin M. Lee, asked Mr. Benioff to help the city’s middle schools.
The mayor wanted to give students a better chance at landing tech jobs.
And he wanted Mr. Benioff to pay for it.
“I would like to give our kids the opportunity, when they graduate, to see themselves working at those tech companies,” Mr. Lee recalled telling Mr. Benioff.
The idea appealed to Mr. Benioff.
At Salesforce, the leading maker of cloud-based customer-relationship management software, he had developed his own model of corporate philanthropy: donating 1 percent of company equity, products and employee time to community programs.
A school project would let him test it on a larger stage.
The district has used money from Salesforce.org to hire math teachers and develop a comprehensive computer science curriculum for prekindergarten through 12th grade.
Funds have also gone toward installing Wi-Fi in middle schools and hiring tech coaches for teachers.
But Mr. Benioff’s “think bigger” mandate also led to culture clashes.
Chief among these: He established a Principal’s Innovation Fund, which awards annual unrestricted grants of $100,000 to the principal at each of the district’s 21 middle and K-8 schools.
The superintendent initially worried that principals might squander the money.
In Silicon Valley, “they fully expect nine out of 10 of their innovations to fail,” said Mr. Carranza, who is now superintendent of the much larger Houston public school system.
“We don’t have the luxury of failing with people’s kids.”
Administrators subsequently asked principals to select projects that fit with the district’s priorities.
Principals have used the grants to start robotics clubs, provide English-tutoring programs for immigrant students and redesign a school library with hangout zones where children can sit with their laptops.
Mr. Benioff said he knew that his methods pushed some administrators beyond their comfort zones.
“You’d have the same issue at Salesforce if somebody from the outside came in and said, ‘We’re going to help you to blah-blah-blah,’” he said.
“Bureaucrats would try to stop them.”
So far, Salesforce.org has provided about $20 million to the schools.
By hiring additional teachers, schools reduced the average class size across eighth-grade math to 24 students from 33 — enabling teachers to give more individualized instruction, district officials said.
“People think school districts are too bureaucratic, can’t be nimble and can’t innovate,” Mr. Carranza said.
“We are proving that this is just not true.”
There are limits to Mr. Benioff’s approach: Most school districts will not be able to secure their own billionaire benefactors.
But Mr. Benioff said he intended to keep working with local schools for decades to come.
“This is not just a sea gull strategy where we are dumping a bunch of money and leaving town,” Mr. Benioff said.
“We are in the trenches.”
What does Netflix have in common with a math-teaching program called DreamBox Learning?
Both services use algorithms to predict what’s good for their users.
They also share a guardian angel: Mr. Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive.
In 2009, he heard about a start-up that used artificial intelligence to adapt math lessons to students.
The math program worked a bit like the software Netflix used to customize its video recommendations.
“It is probably fair to say I recognized the power of personalization maybe more than other people, because I had seen it in my own working life,” Mr. Hastings said in an interview at Netflix’s Los Angeles office.
There was just one problem: DreamBox Learning was running low on cash.
So Mr. Hastings stepped in, donating about $11 million to a nonprofit charter-school fund so it could buy the math platform.
Today, more than two million students use the program for supplemental math instruction.
DreamBox takes elements from animated video games, with some math lessons populated by aliens that whoosh about and animals that cluck.
When students complete a math lesson successfully, they earn points that they can use to unlock virtual rewards.
Administrators in some districts said that students so enjoyed the math program that some had begged their parents to let them play DreamBox even during trips to the supermarket.
But four parents with children in public schools in Baltimore County, Md., said the program was so stimulating that they had curbed its use at home.
“It really can suck a kid in,” said Brenda Peiffer, a former school counselor, whose son, a third grader, was assigned DreamBox for homework.
After noticing that he seemed more interested in spending points to customize his avatar than in actually doing math, she put the kibosh on DreamBox.
“He’s not doing it at home,” she said.
Jessie Woolley-Wilson, the chief executive of DreamBox, said such concerns were rare.
But she recalled a mother once asking if the program was habit-forming, because her daughter was waking her up at 5:30 a.m.
asking to play DreamBox.
Ms. Woolley-Wilson recommended that parents oversee their children’s screen time.
“There’s no perfect solution for everyone,” she said.
And some experienced teachers said it was preposterous to think that algorithms could be better than skilled teachers at adapting to students’ abilities.
“What you are seeing right now is a heavy push to disrupt and diminish the role of teachers as experts,” said Arienne Adamcikova, a high school teacher in San Mateo, Calif.
Mr. Hastings saw it differently.
DreamBox Learning tracks a student’s every click, correct answer, hesitation and error — collecting about 50,000 data points per student per hour — and uses those details to adjust the math lessons it shows.
And it uses data to help teachers pinpoint which math concepts students may be struggling with.
Mr. Hastings described DreamBox as a tool teachers could use to gain greater insights into their students, much the way that physicians use medical scans to treat individual patients.
“A doctor without an X-ray machine is not as good a doctor,” Mr. Hastings said.
So far there is little proof that such technologies significantly improve achievement.
Adaptive learning courseware, for instance, generally did not improve college students’ grades or their likelihood of completing a course, according to a 2016 report on some of these programs by the S.R.I.
Education research group.
Is DreamBox effective?
DreamBox is among the minority of digital learning start-ups that have allowed independent academic researchers to examine and publicly report on their data.
Still, the platform’s effectiveness is difficult to gauge.
A report from Harvard University’s Center for Education Policy Research concluded that DreamBox use correlated with some improved math scores.
But, the researchers cautioned, if those students had more effective teachers even without the technology, “then we might be falsely attributing” student achievement gains “to the software, rather than to the teacher.”
Even so, Ms. Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox’s chief executive, described the study as good news, saying it confirmed encouraging reports from teachers.
She pointed out that, unlike DreamBox, many other education start-ups lacked research to prove even the most basic assumption: that their apps did not harm students’ educational results.
“That sounds like a low bar,” Ms. Woolley-Wilson said.
“But with the history of education technology, it is not.”
Mr. Hastings (who is a company director but has no financial interest in the math company) said he was enthusiastic about DreamBox’s potential and predicted wider classroom use for the technology as artificial intelligence improved.
Still, he emphasized that he did not view technology generally as a panacea for education.
“I’ve always been a little cynical and jaundiced about technology,” Mr. Hastings said.
“The tech can help, but it is often oversold.”
If Facebook’s Mr. Zuckerberg has his way, children the world over will soon be teaching themselves — using software his company helped build.
It’s a conception that upends a longstanding teaching dynamic.
Now educators are no longer classroom leaders, but helpmates.
In public remarks and Facebook posts, Mr. Zuckerberg has described how it works.
Students cluster together, working at laptops.
They use software to select their own assignments, working at their own pace.
And, should they struggle at teaching themselves, teachers are on hand to guide them.
“When you visit a school like this, it feels like the future — it feels like a start-up,” Mr. Zuckerberg told an audience last fall in Peru.
“You get the feeling this is how more of the education system should work.”
He is well on his way to achieving this vision.
In 2015, 19 American schools introduced the software that Facebook helped develop.
This school year, more than 100 schools use it.
Next fall, Mr. Zuckerberg said, he expects that “many hundreds of more schools will upgrade.”
The effort began a few years ago with visits by Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician who is his wife, to Summit Denali, a middle school in Sunnyvale, Calif.
There, classrooms lack walls, and students with laptops often zoom around on caster chairs.
“It looks more like a Google or a Facebook than a school,” said Diane Tavenner, chief executive of Summit Public Schools, a nonprofit charter-school network that runs the school.
Mr. Zuckerberg, she said, admired the software that Summit had created for its schools.
He offered Ms. Tavenner a team of Facebook engineers to further develop it and make it available free to schools nationwide.
Summit developed its student-directed learning approach after administrators there discovered that their teachers had been so supportive of students, Ms. Tavenner said, that many of its graduates were struggling in college, unprepared to pace themselves or seek help.
That is how Summit’s platform came to show students every lesson they will need to complete for the year.
They may tackle lessons in any order.
At the end of each unit, they take a 10-question multiple-choice test.
Teachers use the software to track students’ work and may intervene when a child is struggling.
One-on-one mentoring helps students make choices and evaluate their progress.
In a Facebook post in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg said that this learning approach “frees up time for teachers to do what they do best — mentor students.”
Not all educators agree.
Four former Summit teachers said they found the system problematic.
They asked that their names be withheld, saying they feared repercussions for their careers.
At Summit, they said, they were required to teach students cognitive skills (like how to construct an argument) while making students responsible for teaching themselves underlying lesson material (like how diverse plants and animals coexist).
But some students raced through lessons without actually understanding basic facts, the teachers said, making it difficult to help them structure arguments on specific topics, like climate change.
Ms. Tavenner of Summit, however, said that was exactly the point: to make students discover for themselves that they cannot succeed on applied projects without learning the fundamentals.
Students think to themselves, “‘Oh, I’ve got to actually go back and deeply understand it,’” Ms. Tavenner said.
“Those are the habits of success that we are trying to instill in kids that simply don’t get instilled in the normal system.”
It can be a steep learning curve.
In 2015, Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., introduced the platform for its sixth graders.
But students, accustomed to having a teacher’s guidance, did not know how to pace themselves, said Claire Fisher, the school’s principal.
“Kids were self-pacing to failure,” Ms. Fisher said.
Teachers remedied that by helping students set realistic goals.
The school is now happy with the program, she said, and has expanded it to the seventh grade.
Even so, Ms. Fisher said, “We definitely have a concern about the quality of the assessments in the curriculum and whether it actually promotes deeper learning.”
The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, an organization set up by Dr. Chan and Mr. Zuckerberg to manage their projects in education and other areas, plans to take over Facebook’s engineering role in developing the education software by the end of this year.
Mr. Zuckerberg has big plans in mind for the program.
In his Peru speech, he noted that there were only about 25,000 public secondary schools in the United States.
“Our hope over the next decade is to help upgrade a majority of these schools to personalized learning and then start working globally as well,” Mr. Zuckerberg told the audience.
“Giving a billion students a personalized education is a great thing to do.”
President Trump thrust himself into a bitter Persian Gulf dispute on Tuesday, taking credit for Saudi Arabia’s move to isolate its smaller neighbor, Qatar, and rattling his national security staff by upending a critical American strategic relationship.In a series of tweets, Mr. Trump said his call for an end to the financing of radical groups had prompted Saudi Arabia and four other countries to act this week against Qatar, a tiny, energy-rich emirate that is arguably America’s most important military outpost in the Middle East.
“During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,” he wrote in a midmorning post.
“Leaders pointed to Qatar — look!” Qatar has long been accused of funneling money to the Muslim Brotherhood — which has officially forsworn violence but is still accused of terrorism by some countries — as well as to radical groups in Syria, Libya and other Arab nations.
But it is also home to two major American command posts, including a $60 million center from which the United States and its allies conduct their air war on Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
Those contradictory roles may explain the mixed signals the administration sent after Saudi Arabia’s unexpected move.
Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis initially tried on Monday to smooth over the rift, with Mr. Tillerson offering to play peacemaker and Mr. Mattis insisting it would have no effect on the campaign against the Islamic State.
Less than 12 hours later, however, Mr. Trump discarded that approach by putting his thumb on the scale firmly in Saudi Arabia’s favor.
His tweets, which a senior White House official said were not a result of any policy deliberation, sowed confusion about America’s strategy and its intentions toward a key military partner.
“So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off,” Mr. Trump wrote.
“They said they would take a hard line on funding.”
He added, “Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!”
Additionally, officials in Jordan said on Tuesday that the country would downgrade its diplomatic relations with Qatar and revoke the license of the Doha-based television channel Al Jazeera, Reuters reported.
On Tuesday evening, the president appeared to be trying to ease tensions.
In a call with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump said that unity among gulf nations was “critical to defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability,” according to a White House statement.
Administration officials said Mr. Trump was not trying to cause a rupture among Sunni Muslim nations in the Middle East.
Rather, they said, he was expressing genuine frustration with Qatar’s record and making sure it followed through on the commitments it made in backing a new joint Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, which the president announced last month in Riyadh.
“The U.S. still wants to see this issue de-escalated and resolved immediately, keeping with the principles that the president laid out in terms of defeating terror financing,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.
Mr. Spicer denied that the president was taking sides.
He said Mr. Trump had had a “very productive” discussion with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the 37-year-old emir of Qatar, during his visit to Riyadh.
But another person briefed on the conversation said it had been noticeably colder than the president’s meetings with other gulf leaders.
In Washington, Qatar’s ambassador, Meshal bin Hamad al-Thani, expressed surprise at Mr. Trump’s tweets.
“No one approached us directly and said, ‘Look, we have problems with this and this and this,’” he said in an interview with The Daily Beast.
There was little immediate threat to American military facilities in Qatar, administration officials and outside analysts said, not least because Qatar views America’s military presence as an insurance policy against the aggressive moves of its neighbors.
But the mood there was jittery.
Government officials and news outlets described the cutoff of diplomatic relations, travel and trade as a “siege” and even as an attempt at a coup.
Those jitters have been intensified by suspicions that Russia was behind a cyberattack that published fake information on Qatar’s state news agency — a claim the United States is investigating, according to an official briefed on the inquiry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The official said it was unclear whether the hackers were state-sponsored.
An American diplomat warned that there was a temptation to blame malicious acts on the Russian government before the evidence had been weighed.
But the same diplomat noted that Russia had much to gain from divisions among Iran’s rivals in the region, particularly if they made it more difficult for the United States to use Qatar as a major base.
“For sure, this is an attempt at regime change,” said Jamal Elshayyal, a senior producer for Al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned news channel that many in the region accuse of spreading extremist ideas.
Pentagon officials said they, too, were taken aback by Mr. Trump’s tweets, particularly given the American military’s deep ties to Qatar.
The military has been eager to avoid political quarrels with the Qataris, a goal reflected in statements by its spokesmen.
“The United States and the coalition are grateful to the Qataris for their longstanding support of our presence and their enduring commitment to regional security,” Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, spokesman for the Air Force component of the Central Command, said on Monday.
Al Udeid Air Base, outside the Qatari capital, Doha, is home to more than 11,000 American and coalition service members.
Mr. Mattis made a point of visiting in April, spending three nights in Doha, where he met with the emir.
Mr. Trump’s tweets also appeared to contradict the American ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, who this week retweeted a post of hers saying Qatar had made “real progress” in curbing financial support for terrorists.
On Tuesday, an American diplomat in Doha said that Qatar’s relationship with the United States was “strong” and that it had made strides: prosecuting people suspected of funding terrorist groups, freezing assets and putting stringent controls on its banks.
Not for the first time, Mr. Trump’s comments differed sharply from those of his top national security aides.
“We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters in Sydney, Australia, where he and Mr. Mattis were meeting with officials on Monday.
Mr. Mattis added, “I am positive there will be no implications coming out of this dramatic situation at all.”
In addition to hosting the air command center, Qatar is the home of the forward headquarters of the United States Central Command and an American intelligence hub in the Middle East.
It also has deep ties to American academia, providing funding and property to build Middle Eastern campuses for six major universities, including Cornell, Georgetown and Northwestern.
Qatar’s financing of radical groups has long been a source of tension with Washington.
But the United States has generally avoided taking sides in the regional feuds in the Persian Gulf, because it has strategic partnerships with several countries and most of them, including Saudi Arabia, have a record of financing extremist groups.
“Clearly, the Saudis and the Emiratis felt they had someone in the White House who would take their side,” said Robert Malley, who coordinated Middle East policy in the Obama administration.
“This puts Qatar in a tough position: Either make a dramatic policy shift or face deeper isolation.”
Others analysts were more critical, saying the Saudis had exploited Mr. Trump by seizing on the good will generated during his visit to carry out a long-planned move against a smaller neighbor.
“The Saudis played Donald Trump like a fiddle,” said Bruce O. Riedel, a former intelligence analyst who advised Mr. Obama and now works at the Brookings Institution.
“He unwittingly encouraged their worst instincts toward their neighbors.”
It is not the first time the White House has struggled to explain Mr. Trump’s statements about a security partnership.
Just last month, during a visit to NATO headquarters in Belgium, he declined to reaffirm America’s commitment to the alliance’s principle of mutual defense, after a senior administration official had told The New York Times he would.
That line was deleted from Mr. Trump’s speech shortly before he delivered it, according to Politico, to the surprise of officials including Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis.
On Tuesday, Mr. Spicer described persistent questions about the episode as “a bit silly,” saying Mr. Trump’s mere presence at the NATO ceremony was evidence of the American commitment to mutual defense.
Uber has fired 20 employees over harassment, discrimination and inappropriate behavior, as the ride-hailing company tries to contain the fallout from a series of toxic revelations about its workplace.Uber disclosed the terminations on Tuesday at a staff meeting at its San Francisco headquarters, according to an employee who attended the event but was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
The firings, which occurred in the last few months, stem from an internal investigation into Uber’s workplace, the employee said.
The company did not name the people who were fired, but some were senior executives, the employee said.
The firings were aimed at tackling what many at Uber say are deep-seated management and cultural issues, which have made the company a cautionary tale for what can go wrong with Silicon Valley’s often freewheeling corporate culture.
Uber has been a lightning rod because of its aggressive chief executive, Travis Kalanick, who has flouted rules and regulations to turn the company into a nearly $70 billion behemoth.
Uber’s difficulties have revived questions about how the tech industry treats women and employees in general — and whether start-ups can recover from such stumbles.
“You only terminate 20 people after you’ve determined after an investigation that there is something very, very wrong at the company,” said Deborah Weinstein, the president of the Weinstein Firm, which deals with employment and workplace law issues.
“Most places don’t have this level of things going wrong.”
Uber’s workplace troubles began in February when Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, said in a blog post that she was sexually harassed by her supervisor there and that the human resources department ignored the claims.
Other employees have since reported systemic issues in the company, saying that a premium was placed on workers who delivered strong performance and aggressive growth, and that their behavioral transgressions were often overlooked.
Those disclosures plunged Uber into crisis, putting Mr. Kalanick and his lieutenants under scrutiny and raising concerns about how far is too far when it comes to the behavior of the company’s 12,000 full-time employees.
(Uber’s drivers are contractors, not employees.)
Uber has since faced more problems.
It is embroiled in a lawsuit with Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google’s parent company, over autonomous vehicle technology, leading Uber to last week dismiss a top engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who was named in the suit.
The Justice Department has also opened an inquiry into Uber’s use of a tool to evade authorities who were trying to shut down the ride-hailing service.
After Ms. Fowler’s claims, Uber hired Eric H. Holder Jr., former attorney general, and his law firm, Covington & Burling, to conduct an independent investigation of the claims and to assess the ride-hailing company’s culture.
Mr. Holder’s report has been delivered to Uber’s board, and the company plans to make some of it public next week, as well as to discuss the findings with employees.
The terminations announced to employees on Tuesday, which were earlier reported by Bloomberg, are the result of a separate investigation by Perkins Coie, another law firm Uber hired.
Lawyers from Perkins Coie consulted with Uber on the internal investigation, and the company acted on the firm’s recommendations.
Bobbie Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, said the firm was focused on “specific” allegations raised from a hotline that Uber set up so employees could send information in confidence.
Mr. Holder’s investigation is more broad and focused on Uber’s overall culture.
Some companies strategically choose to divide an investigation between two investigators to protect lawyer-client privilege, said Liz Rita, an employment lawyer and owner of Investigations Law Group based in Denver.
In such a scenario, one investigator may handle elements involving more sensitive or higher litigation risk, and a second investigator may handle findings that may be disclosed more publicly.
This is done to protect a company from inadvertently waiving lawyer-client privilege if they publicly reveal parts of an investigation without disclosing all the findings.
Ms. Wilson, the partner at Perkins Coie, said the firm was tapped almost immediately after Ms. Fowler’s blog post was made public.
The lawyers combed through thousands of internal documents and emails, and interviewed current and former employees to corroborate claims by Ms. Fowler and others.
“We were given unfettered access,” Ms. Wilson said in an interview.
“We did a thorough and painstaking investigation into all of Ms. Fowler’s allegations.
We spoke to people — anybody frankly — who wanted to give us information on the company’s issues.”
Some tips came in through the internal hotline that Uber created.
Other information came through Liane Hornsey, Uber’s chief human resources officer, as well as to Arianna Huffington, a member of the company’s board of directors.
In a CNN interview in March, Ms. Huffington said of what she had been hearing from Uber employees that “yes, there were some bad apples, unquestionably.”
“But this is not a systemic problem,” she added.
In total, Ms. Wilson said that more than 215 cases of workplace violations were investigated at Uber, of which roughly 100 resulted in no action being taken.
Forty-seven of the cases were related to sexual harassment, and 54 involved some form of discrimination.
Others fell under the categories of unprofessional behavior, including bullying, retaliation, physical security and other nonsexual forms of harassment.
Thirty-one employees are now undergoing some form of workplace training, and seven others have been given final warnings, Uber said.
There are 57 complaints still under review.
“If there was something serious, we didn’t wait to tell Uber,” Ms. Wilson said.
“The company wasn’t going to wait for some future point in time to take action.”
She declined to comment on who was fired and declined to be specific about the episodes for which people were let go.
Uber has been making a series of other personnel changes, separate from the firings, in the wake of the harassment claims.
Since February, there have been a string of executive departures.
Amit Singhal, a former Google executive named as Uber’s senior vice president for engineering, left abruptly after he failed to disclose sexual harassment charges against him from his tenure at Google.
Ed Baker, a vice president, also left in March.
More recently, Uber has hired several new executives.
On Monday, the company said it was bringing on Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor and management consultant, as its first senior vice president for leadership and strategy.
The company confirmed another hire on Tuesday, that of Bozoma St. John, a former Apple executive, who will come aboard in the newly created position of chief brand officer.
Uber is still searching for a chief operating officer to assist Mr. Kalanick, who said this year that he needed more leadership help, after being caught on video berating an Uber driver.
Gov. Jerry Brown of California should be fading quietly into the final days of his career.
After 40 years in public life, Mr. Brown, 79, a Democrat, is in the final stretch as the state’s chief executive.
He has been talking about the Colusa County family ranch where he wants to retire.
And a battery of younger politicians is already battling to succeed him.But instead, Mr. Brown was in China on Tuesday, emerging as a de facto envoy from the United States on climate change at a time when President Trump has renounced efforts to battle global emissions.
In a meeting packed with symbolism — and one that seemed at once to elevate the California governor and rebuke Mr. Trump — President Xi Jinping of China met with Mr. Brown, at the governor’s request, at the very moment China prepares to take a more commanding role in fighting climate change.
“California’s leading, China’s leading,” Mr. Brown said at a wide-ranging and at times feisty news conference after he met with Mr. Xi.
“It’s true I didn’t come to Washington, I came to Beijing.
Well, someday I’m going to go to Washington, but not this week.”
Mr. Brown has long used his platform as governor to advocate emission reduction policies, both in his state and globally.
But the decision by Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, on the eve of Mr. Brown’s trip here, gave an already planned visit new visibility.
The son of a governor, Mr. Brown has been in public office — or running for public office — nearly every year since he was elected secretary of state in 1970.
This is the second time he has served as governor.
He ran for president three times.
He has been mayor of Oakland, the chairman of the California Democratic Party and the state’s attorney general.
But the election of Mr. Trump, and his decision to pull out of the climate accord last week, suggests that Mr. Brown’s likely final act in public life is going to be much different than he ever imagined.
Instead of fighting, to name one example, for the high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco that has been his mission for more than five years — or guarding against what he sees as financial excesses by the state Legislature as it adopts its next budget — Mr. Brown, with 18 months left in office, has stepped into a void left by Mr. Trump.
In so doing, he has moved way beyond the stage of Sacramento, embracing an issue that he has been identified with since he first ran for governor and in a state that is known for championing environmental causes.
“I’m more energized and activated than ever,” Mr. Brown said, as he finished the third day of his trip.
“And I think that we’re actually making more progress.”
Still, California’s confrontations with the Trump administration on climate change are risky: The state has been wary that the Environmental Protection Agency may move to revoke a waiver permitting California to set fuel economy standards that exceed federal requirements.
That waiver, which has been central to the state’s success at reducing emissions, was issued when Richard M. Nixon was president.
If it were revoked, the state would be forced to lower its strict fuel economy standards and it would be less able to influence national environmental policy.
And Mr. Brown, as a state leader, cannot command the leverage of a global leader in any United Nations negotiations on the future of the Paris accord.
“You can’t stop a state from doing what they want to do in this area,” said Thomas Pyle, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries who worked for Mr. Trump’s transition team and serves as president of the Institute for Energy Research, a pro fossil-fuel research organization.
“They can flex their muscles but they can’t represent the U.S.” Some national Republicans were fairly dismissive of Mr. Brown’s appearance.
“I hope that Governor Brown gets as good a deal for California as China got from the Paris climate agreement,” Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, said in a reference to some Republicans’ views that China got the better end of the Paris deal.
For Mr. Xi, Mr. Brown’s visit could not have been better timed — allowing him to act on declarations that China would now become a global leader on climate change.
It is unusual for a Chinese president to meet with an American governor in such a formal setting in Beijing.
Mr. Xi’s session with Mr. Brown was covered extensively by the government-controlled news media.
The state broadcaster featured it as the second story on the evening news, after a segment on China’s ambitions in outer space, an indication of the meeting’s importance to the ruling Communist Party.
At such a volatile moment in Washington, the meeting allowed Mr. Xi to focus on the common ground China shares with some American politicians.
China has historically maintained relationships with leaders of parties not in power as a practical matter, in the West and in places like Myanmar and Taiwan.
Gary Locke, a former American ambassador to China and governor of Washington, said Chinese leaders were “well aware” that Mr. Brown was considered a “strong leader” on climate change and a critic of Mr. Trump.
Analysts said that Mr. Xi might have also wanted to show Mr. Trump that China was willing to work around him by strengthening ties with allies like Europe, India and California.
Mr. Brown’s endorsement may also serve as a buffer against critics who say that China is moving too slowly to curb emissions.
“He wants to retain the positive — if oversold — image China earned by stepping up to the plate alongside the United States,” said Elizabeth C. Economy, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Chinese accounts of the meeting did not mention the Paris accord or Mr. Trump.
Mr. Brown said Mr. Xi never criticized the American president.
Mr. Brown, who was attending an energy conference in Beijing, arrived just days before David H. Rank, the chargé d’affaires of the American Embassy in Beijing, resigned in protest of the president’s decision on the Paris agreement.
Rick Perry, the energy secretary, was here as well for the energy conference, though he apparently did not meet with Mr. Xi.
Mr. Xi met with Mr. Brown in an ornate room in the Great Hall of the People where he often meets visiting foreign leaders.
In their 45-minute conversation, Mr. Xi was joined by his top foreign policy officials as he discussed with Mr. Brown efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote alternative energy.
As a gift, Mr. Brown gave Mr. Xi a first-edition copy of “The Mountains of California,” a 1894 book by John Muir, a naturalist who wrote extensively about the splendors of the California wilderness.
“I would say that the California-China collaboration has taken a real leap forward,” Mr. Brown said as he recounted the meeting for reporters.
Mr. Brown has spent the past several days traveling around China to meet with officials about efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote green technologies.
He signed agreements on clean energy technological development with officials in the southwestern province of Sichuan and the eastern province of Jiangsu.
California operates a cap-and-trade market, allowing companies to buy and sell greenhouse gas emission allowances, making it more costly for companies to emit at high levels.
China plans to start a national emissions trading plan by the end of the year.
Mr. Brown and other Democratic leaders of California have made clear that they would push ahead on the state’s leading-edge efforts to reduce all emissions no matter what happens in Washington.
Mr. Brown, clearly relishing the attention he was drawing to the state, said the lesson California had learned as it imposed limits on emissions was that it did not interfere with economic growth or cause hardship.
“Sacrifice is not a term that is that popular these days,” he said.
“I think happy-time news is what people like from their politicians, even if the news can be a little more dire than that.”
“I don’t think we’re going to have to put on a hair shirt and eat bean sprouts,” Mr. Brown said.
“I think we can have quite a rich life, but we’re going to have to get going and make the transition.”
Christopher A. Wray was the government’s top criminal prosecutor in 2004 when the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, and the deputy attorney general, James B. Comey, threatened to quit the Bush administration over a controversial surveillance program.
He offered to join their protest.Now, with President Trump’s selection of Mr. Wray on Wednesday to be the director of the F.B.I., all three men will be central figures in the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election that has rocked the Trump administration.
Mr. Mueller is leading the investigation into Russian influence — and the inquiry led Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Comey.
In choosing Mr. Wray, the president is calling on a veteran Washington lawyer who is more low key and deliberative than either Mr. Mueller or Mr. Comey but will remain independent, friends and former colleagues say.
“He’s not flashy.
He’s not showy.
He’s understated,” said J. Michael Luttig, a former judge who hired Mr. Wray as a law clerk in 1992.
Mr. Luttig, who said he counted Mr. Comey and Mr. Mueller as friends, said Mr. Wray would bring a more subtle management style to the F.B.I.
Calling Mr. Wray a “man of impeccable credentials,” Mr. Trump revealed his choice in an early-morning tweet on the eve of a congressional hearing in which Mr. Comey was to testify about what he interpreted as improper attempts by Mr. Trump to pressure him.
Mr. Wray is a safe, mainstream pick from a president who at one point was considering politicians for a job that has historically been kept outside partisanship.
A former assistant attorney general under President George W. Bush, Mr. Wray is likely to assuage the fears of F.B.I. agents who worried that Mr. Trump would try to weaken or politicize the agency.
Those who know Mr. Wray say his willingness to quit the Justice Department more than a decade ago as a matter of principle showed he would brush back attempts at political interference and try to protect the bureau’s independence.
Questions on that willingness are certain to come up at his Senate confirmation hearing.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly interjected himself into criminal justice matters in ways that previous presidents have avoided.
His dismissal of Mr. Comey has been criticized as an effort to obstruct the F.B.I.’s investigation into Mr. Trump’s campaign and possible collusion with Russia.
Mr. Mueller is now acting as the Justice Department’s special counsel overseeing the investigation.
He and Mr. Wray respect each other, Mr. Luttig said, predicting they would work well together.
If confirmed, Mr. Wray will have to balance fighting terrorism with trying to root out public corruption and confronting Russian and Chinese espionage at the nation’s top law enforcement organization, which has evolved into a major part of the national security apparatus.
He would lead about 35,000 people at an agency where many are seeking a calming presence after nearly a year of turmoil.
“He’ll have a strong emphasis on creating and nurturing the trust of every F.B.I. agent,” said Joe D. Whitley, a former senior Justice Department official who has known Mr. Wray for years.
Mr. Wray is a familiar figure in Washington; he took a top job with the Justice Department in the spring of 2001, playing a pivotal role in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by overseeing operations.
Mr. Wray is likely to face questions at his confirmation hearing about what he knew about C.I.A. abuses in the years after the attacks and how the Justice Department responded to them.
According to government documents since made public, he was made aware in February 2004 of the death of a C.I.A. detainee in Iraq that had been ruled a homicide and whose case was referred to the Justice Department.
Months later, Mr. Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had learned about the death from media reports and was not aware of a criminal referral from the Pentagon or the F.B.I., but did not say whether he knew of one from the C.I.A.
That prompted Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, a Democrat, to accuse Mr. Wray of giving “less than a complete and truthful answer.”
Mr. Wray went on to serve as head of the criminal division from 2003 to 2005, directing efforts to deal with corporate fraud scandals and political investigations.
Chris Swecker, the former head of the F.B.I. criminal investigations division, said Mr. Wray was unafraid to pursue sensitive corruption cases that included prosecutions of the disgraced former lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the former Representatives Randy Cunningham and William J. Jefferson.
After leaving for private practice at the law firm King & Spalding, Mr. Wray represented Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a former Justice Department colleague, in the so-called Bridgegate scandal over a politically motivated scheme to cause traffic jams.
Two former aides to Mr. Christie, an ally of Mr. Trump, were found guilty and sentenced to prison; the governor was not charged.
That Mr. Wray’s political skills were honed in the crucible of scandal gave him an edge over the other finalist, John S. Pistole, a former deputy director of the F.B.I. and head of the Transportation Security Administration, administration officials said.
Mr. Wray had managed to soothe and counsel the volatile Mr. Christie.
The American Civil Liberties Union voiced concerns on Wednesday about Mr. Wray’s nomination, citing his oversight role after the Sept. 11 attacks and his work for Mr. Christie, which “makes us question his ability to lead the F.B.I. with the independence, evenhanded judgment and commitment to the rule of law that the agency deserves,” the organization said in a statement.
The A.C.L.U. also called on senators to vigorously question Mr. Wray about what he knew, as the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, about  abuses of detainees in American custody in Iraq and Afghanistan and at Guantánamo Bay.
Mr. Wray graduated in 1989 from Yale University, where he met his future wife, Helen, in his freshman dormitory.
Her family once owned the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Mr. Wray rowed crew in high school and college, said Andrew C. Hruska, his law partner and friend since childhood.
“His willingness to put in a tremendous amount of effort toward a team goal really personifies Chris,” Mr. Hruska said.
He earned his law degree in 1992 from Yale Law School.
After clerking for Mr. Luttig, Mr. Wray moved to Atlanta and joined the office of the United States attorney there.
While Mr. Wray does not have a reputation as a partisan operative, he has donated consistently to Republican candidates.
Over the past decade, he has contributed at least $35,000 to Republican candidates or committees, according to Federal Election Commission data.
He did not do so during the 2016 election, but he has donated to Republican presidential nominees, including $2,300 to support Senator John McCain of Arizona in 2008 and $7,500 to Mitt Romney in 2012.
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee, said he was approaching Mr. Wray’s choice with caution.
“Above all, he will need to show his commitment to protecting the bureau’s independence,” Mr. Whitehouse said.
Mr. Wray will not tolerate meddling, his friends say.
“He certainly understands the appropriate norms that exist between the Justice Department, F.B.I. and White House,” said John C. Richter, a fellow lawyer at King & Spalding who was a former federal prosecutor in Atlanta.
Fossils discovered in Morocco are the oldest known remains of Homo sapiens, scientists reported on Wednesday, a finding that rewrites the story of mankind’s origins and suggests that our species evolved in multiple locations across the African continent.“We
did not evolve from a single ‘cradle of mankind’ somewhere in East Africa,” said Philipp Gunz, a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and a co-author of two new studies on the fossils, published in the journal Nature.
“We evolved on the African continent.”
Until now, the oldest known fossils of our species dated back just 195,000 years.
The Moroccan fossils, by contrast, are roughly 300,000 years old.
Remarkably, they indicate that early Homo sapiens had faces much like our own, although their brains differed in fundamental ways.
Today, the closest living relatives to Homo sapiens are chimpanzees and bonobos, with whom we share a common ancestor that lived over six million years ago.
After the split from this ancestor, our ancient forebears evolved into many different species, known as hominins.
For millions of years, hominins remained very apelike.
They were short, had small brains and could fashion only crude stone tools.
Until now, the oldest fossils that clearly belonged to Homo sapiens were discovered in Ethiopia.
In 2003, researchers working at a site called Herto discovered a skull estimated to be between 160,000 and 154,000 years old.
A pair of partial skulls from another site, Omo-Kibish, dated to around 195,000 years of age, at the time making these the oldest fossils of our species.
Findings such as these suggested that our species evolved in a small region — perhaps in Ethiopia, or nearby in East Africa.
After Homo sapiens arose, researchers believed, the species spread out across the continent.
Only much later — roughly 70,000 years ago — did a small group of Africans make their way to other continents.
Yet paleoanthropologists were aware of mysterious hominin fossils discovered in other parts of Africa that did not seem to fit the narrative.
In 1961, miners in Morocco dug up a few pieces of a skull at a site called Jebel Irhoud.
Later digs revealed a few more bones, along with flint blades.
Using crude techniques, researchers estimated the remains to be 40,000 years old.
In the 1980s, however, a paleoanthropologist named Jean-Jacques Hublin took a closer look at one jawbone.
The teeth bore some resemblance to those of living humans, but the shape seemed strangely primitive.
“It did not make sense,” Dr. Hublin, now at the Max Planck Institute, recalled in an interview.
Since 2004, Dr. Hublin and his colleagues have been working through layers of rocks on a desert hillside at Jebel Irhoud.
They have found a wealth of fossils, including skull bones from five individuals who all died around the same time.
Just as important, the scientists discovered flint blades in the same sedimentary layer as the skulls.
The people of Jebel Irhoud most likely made them for many purposes, putting some on wooden handles to fashion spears.
Many of the flint blades showed signs of having been burned.
The people at Jebel Irhoud probably lit fires to cook food, heating discarded blades buried in the ground below.
This accident of history made it possible to use the flints as historical clocks.
Dr. Hublin and his colleagues used a method called thermoluminescence to calculate how much time had passed since the blades were burned.
They estimated that the blades were roughly 300,000 years old.
The skulls, discovered in the same rock layer, must have been the same age.
Despite the age of the teeth and jaws, anatomical details showed they nevertheless belonged to Homo sapiens, not to another hominin group, such as the Neanderthals.
Resetting the clock on mankind’s debut would be achievement enough.
But the new research is also notable for the discovery of several early humans rather than just one, as so often happens, said Marta Mirazon Lahr, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the new study.
“We have no other place like it, so it’s a fabulous finding,” she said.
The people at Jebel Irhoud shared a general resemblance to one another — and to living humans.
Their brows were heavy, their chins small, their faces flat and wide.
But all in all, they were not so different from people today.
“The face is that of somebody you could come across in the Metro,” Dr. Hublin said.
The flattened faces of early Homo sapiens may have something to do with the advent of speech, speculated Christopher Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London.
“We really are at very early stages of trying to explain these things,” Dr. Stringer said.
The brains of the inhabitants of Jebel Irhoud, on the other hand, were less like our own.
Although they were as big as modern human brains, they did not yet have its distinctively round shape.
They were long and low, like those of earlier hominins.
Dr. Gunz, of the Max Planck Institute, said that the human brain may have become rounder at a later phase of evolution.
Two regions in the back of the brain appear to have become enlarged over thousands of years.
“I think what we see reflect adaptive changes in the way the brain functions,” he said.
Still, he added, no one knows how a rounder brain changed how we think.
The people of Jebel Irhoud were certainly sophisticated.
They could make fires and craft complex weapons, such as wooden handled spears, needed to kill gazelles and other animals that grazed the savanna that covered the Sahara 300,000 years ago.
The flint is interesting for another reason: Researchers traced its origin to another site about 20 miles south of Jebel Irhoud.
Early Homo sapiens, then, knew how to search out and to use resources spread over long distances.
Similar flint blades of about the same age have been found at other sites across Africa, and scientists have long wondered who made them.
The fossils at Jebel Irhoud raise the possibility that they were made by early Homo sapiens.
And if that is true, Dr. Gunz and his colleagues argue, then our species may have been evolving as a network of groups spread across the continent.
John Hawks, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Wisconsin who was not involved in the new study, said that it was a plausible idea, but that recent discoveries of fossils from the same era raise the possibility that they were used by other hominins.
Armed assailants, including some disguised as women, stunned Iran on Wednesday with brazen attacks on the Parliament building and the tomb of its revolutionary founder, the worst terrorist strike to hit the Islamic republic in years.At least 12 people were killed and 46 were wounded in the near-simultaneous assaults, which lasted for hours, clearly took Iran’s elite security forces by surprise and shattered the self-proclaimed image of calm in a turbulent region.
The six known attackers also were killed, official news media said, and five suspects were reported detained.
Their identities were not made clear.
“We will avenge the blood of those martyred in today’s terrorism attacks,” said Brig.
Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the country’s powerful paramilitary force.
In a statement, the Revolutionary Guards appeared to blame Saudi Arabia and the United States for the assaults even as responsibility for them was asserted by the Islamic State, the Sunni extremist group that has taken credit for terrorist attacks around the world in the past few weeks.
If the Islamic State’s claim is true, that would be its first successful attack in Iran, which is predominantly Shiite Muslim and regarded by Sunni militants as a nation of heretics.
Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria are helping battle the Islamic State.
Eleven people died in the Parliament building assault, and one at the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, father of the 1979 revolution, whose shrine is a magnet for visitors.
Four of the assailants were killed at the Parliament building, official news media said, and two at the mausoleum.
Five were men, and one mausoleum assailant was a woman.
The audacity of the assaults, and the hours it took to end them, suggested that Iranian security officials had been caught unprepared — especially for what seemed like a coordinated plan conceived well in advance.
“It’s very clear that for this group to be able to mount such attacks it must have had a network inside the country that was not put in place yesterday, an infrastructure that took time to develop,” said Randa Slim, an analyst at the Middle East Institute in Washington.
Tensions in the Middle East were already high after a visit by President Trump last month, in which he exalted and emboldened Saudi Arabia, Iran’s regional rival.
Saudi Arabia and several Sunni allies led a regional effort on Monday to isolate Qatar, the tiny Persian Gulf country that maintains good relations with Iran.
Expressions of sympathy from world leaders for the victims poured in after the assaults.
But hours elapsed before a condolence statement was issued by the Trump administration, which has called Iran the leading state sponsor of terrorism.
“The United States condemns the terrorist attacks in Tehran today,” the statement from the State Department said, adding, “The depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful, civilized world.”
Afterward, however, the White House press office issued a modified version with a swipe at Iran’s government.
“We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote,” the statement said.
On Thursday, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, denounced the statement on Twitter.
“Repugnant WH statement & Senate sanctions as Iranians counter terror backed by US clients.
Iranian people reject such US claims of friendship,” he said.
The Saudis rejected Iran’s accusation of complicity.
Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, speaking in Germany, said that he did not know who was responsible and that “we condemn terrorist attacks anywhere they occur.”
Hours earlier, Mr. Jubeir said Iran should be punished for what he called its interference in the region.
In their public pronouncements, Iranian leaders sought to belittle the assailants and their acts, emphasizing that the Parliament chamber itself had never been breached.
“The Iranian nation is moving forward and advancing; even these firecrackers that were set off today will not impact our nation’s will; everyone must know this,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nation’s supreme leader, said on his official website.
The speaker of Parliament, Ali Larijani, called the attacks a “minor incident,” saying that “some cowardly terrorists” had infiltrated the legislative complex.
But accounts of lawmakers and journalists stuck inside the Parliament building suggested panic and mayhem, and state news media video showed some people escaping through windows.
The attacks started around 10:30 a.m., when men armed with assault rifles and suicide vests — some of them dressed as women — descended on the Parliament building, killing at least one guard and wounding and kidnapping other people.
That standoff lasted until midafternoon.
In a sign that elite security forces had trouble containing the situation, one attacker left the Parliament building after an hour, ran around shooting on Tehran’s streets, then returned to the building — where at least one assailant blew himself up on the fourth floor as others fired from the windows.
“I cannot talk, I’m stuck here, and the situation is really dangerous, the shooting is continuing, we are surrounded, and I cannot talk,” an Iranian journalist, Ehsan Bodaghi, said by phone from inside the building during the standoff.
Korosh Karmpur, a member of Parliament, said in an account reported by the Tasnim News Agency that he had played dead to avoid getting shot after leaving the hall to receive an arriving guest.
He was chatting with a guard, Mr. Karmpur said, when gunfire erupted.
“As soon as one guard fell, a person screaming ‘Allahu akbar’ started firing on people and a second person followed and kept firing with a Kalashnikov,” Mr. Karmpur said.
“I didn’t have a weapon, so I dropped to the floor so the terrorists would think I also was hit.”
He said the assailants kept shooting in a failed effort to enter the parliamentary chamber, then headed for lawmaker offices on a different floor.
Mohammad Ali Saki, editor of The Tehran Times, said in a phone interview that the Parliament building assailants had “targeted guards, cleaners, employees of the administrative and finance sections,” but had “never got near the Parliament chamber itself.”
The assailants were armed with AK-47s and hand grenades and wore what appeared to be explosive vests, he said.
Mohammed Abasi, a photographer who arrived as the attack was unfolding, said that he saw security forces “firing at the attackers from outside” and that some reporters and photographers covering the Parliament session were stuck inside awaiting rescue.
“Naturally, for a few hours a terrorist attack like this leaves a shock: Our countrymen were killed, and this was a terrorist attack,” he said.
“But I already see that it is uniting Iranians — there is a sense of fight.”
The Islamic State released a graphic 24-second video showing a bloodied man lying in the Parliament building while a gunman shouted in Arabic: “Thank God! Do you think that we are going to leave?
We will remain here, God willing.”
The assault on the Khomeini mausoleum, about 10 miles south of Parliament, lasted for about 90 minutes, state news media reported.
Two assailants entered the west wing of the sprawling compound.
According to local news agencies, at least one attacker detonated explosives in the western entrance.
Another was reported to have committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill, although another account said the militant had been shot to death by security forces.
Mohammed Ali Ansari, overseer of the mausoleum, said that militants who appeared to have explosives strapped to them “started shooting blindly and without a target.”
In the view of many in Iran, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is inextricably linked to Saudi Arabia.
“ISIS ideologically, financially and logistically is fully supported and sponsored by Saudi Arabia — they are one and the same,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst.
One Iranian security official said the attacks had been a message from Saudi Arabia meant to teach Iran a lesson.
He also said the assaults were intended to test Iran’s reaction.
While terrorist attacks have become more frequent in Europe and in much of the Middle East, Iran had remained comparatively safe.
During May’s election campaign, President Hassan Rouhani often lauded the country’s security forces and intelligence agencies for their vigilance.
For many years, however, the country endured a bitter campaign of attacks by an armed opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq or M.E.K., which for decades had been supported by the former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein.
In many M.E.K. attacks, members would take cyanide when cornered.
In 2012, the group was taken off the United States’ list of terrorist organizations with the support of conservative Republicans who sought to recast it as a legitimate political opposition organization, which also goes by the name of the National Council of Resistance of Iran.
Some Iranian analysts suggested that the M.E.K. may have been connected to the Wednesday assaults, partly because of the targets: M.E.K. leaders had said Ayatollah Khomeini’s tomb would be among their first.
The use of a female attacker and cyanide pill to commit suicide also smacked of the M.E.K.’s past practices.
“This is not to say that the attack was an M.E.K. operation,” said Rasool Nafisi, an Iranian-American scholar, “but it is fair to say that the group’s ‘expertise’ might have been utilized in training those terrorists who targeted Iran.”
The group condemned the attacks, denied involvement and accused Iran’s leaders of having secretly welcomed them.
Maryam Rajavi, president of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, said online that Ayatollah Khamenei was “trying to switch the place of murderer and the victim and portray the central banker of terrorism as a victim.”
From his first days in office, President Trump repeatedly put pressure on his F.B.I. director, James B. Comey.
He demanded loyalty.
He asked that an investigation into an adviser be dropped.
And he implored Mr. Comey to publicly clear his name.As Mr. Comey described Wednesday in  written testimony prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s entreaties continued for months, in unexpected phone calls and awkward meetings.
As Mr. Comey’s discomfort grew, so did the president’s persistence and his frustration with Mr. Comey’s unwillingness to help.
Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last month, and his account offered an extraordinary back story, one that unfolded with cinematic detail, terse dialogue and tense moments across a White House dinner table.
Mr. Comey is scheduled to deliver the testimony on Thursday at a Senate hearing that is shaping up to be the most dramatic moment so far in the tangle of congressional and F.B.I. investigations into Mr. Trump’s associates and possible collusion with Russian operatives during the 2016 election.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied any such collaboration, and Mr. Comey confirmed that he told the president three times that he was not personally under investigation.
Mr. Trump had encouraged Mr. Comey to say so publicly, but Mr. Comey refused — in part because he did not want to have to recant if that changed.
“He asked what we could do to ‘lift the cloud,’” Mr. Comey wrote after a March 30 phone call with Mr. Trump.
“I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well.
He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.”
Many of the details in his testimony have been reported in recent weeks by The New York Times and other news organizations.
But in addition to filling out Mr. Comey’s account, his remarks added to the chorus of questions about Mr. Trump’s efforts to torpedo the investigation — questions that senior national security officials refused to answer in a separate congressional hearing on Wednesday.
By asking that his remarks be released a day early, Mr. Comey also overshadowed the president’s announcement that he would nominate Christopher A. Wray to be the next F.B.I. director.
And Mr. Comey surprised the White House, which had been preparing to defend against him, but not until Thursday.
“The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe,” Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, said in a statement.
“The president feels completely and totally vindicated.
He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.”
Mr. Comey’s testimony chronicled a relationship that was strained from the beginning.
At a meeting at Trump Tower on Jan. 6, two weeks before Inauguration Day, Mr. Comey briefed Mr. Trump on the contents of a dossier of salacious, unsubstantiated allegations that a former British spy believed the Russian government had collected on Mr. Trump.
In that meeting, Mr. Comey assured Mr. Trump that F.B.I. agents were not investigating him personally, Mr. Comey said.
“I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo,” Mr. Comey said.
“To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an F.B.I. vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting.”
That became Mr. Comey’s standard practice after his conversations with Mr. Trump.
“This had not been my practice in the past,” Mr. Comey said, a sign of his unease with their conversations and of how unusual the situation was.
Mr. Comey met alone just twice with President Barack Obama in more than three years as F.B.I. director.
Soon after Mr. Trump took office, he summoned Mr. Comey to the White House.
Over dinner on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump asked whether Mr. Comey wanted to keep his job, an unexpected question because F.B.I. directors have 10-year terms, Mr. Trump had already asked him to stay and Mr. Comey had notified his work force that he would.
“My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship,” Mr. Comey wrote.
“That concerned me greatly.”
Moments later, Mr. Comey wrote, the president told him, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.”
“I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed,” Mr. Comey wrote.
“We simply looked at each other in silence.”
While the F.B.I. is a component of the Justice Department, a part of the president’s cabinet, the bureau is generally regarded as independent, particularly on matters of law enforcement.
Conversations between the F.B.I. and the White House are seen as so perilous that Justice Department rules strictly limit who can have them.
Mr. Comey, in particular, regards himself as fiercely independent — a position he has staked out over the years to both his benefit and his detriment.
“I need loyalty,” Mr. Trump repeated.
“You will always get honesty from me,” Mr. Comey says he replied.
“That’s what I want,” Mr. Trump said.
“Honest loyalty.”
Mr. Comey said he paused and said the president would have it.
“I decided it wouldn’t be productive to push it further,” Mr. Comey wrote.
“The term — honest loyalty — had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.”
After an Oval Office meeting on terrorism a few weeks later, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to stay behind to talk.
Mr. Trump said he wanted to talk about Michael T. Flynn, who had resigned as national security adviser a day earlier and was under investigation over his foreign ties.
“He is a good guy and has been through a lot,” Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Comey’s testimony.
He added: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.
He is a good guy.
I hope you can let this go.”
Mr. Trump’s intent is important.
Some in Congress believe Mr. Trump was trying to interfere with the F.B.I. investigation, and the newly appointed special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has the authority to investigate obstruction.
For Mr. Comey, though, the meaning was clear.
“I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn,” he said.
Mr. Comey told senior F.B.I. officials about the meeting but withheld it from the agents conducting the investigation.
The F.B.I. did not drop the case, and Mr. Mueller is investigating both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.
On March 30, Mr. Comey said, he received a call in his office from the president.
“He described the Russia investigation as ‘a cloud’ that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country,” Mr. Comey wrote.
Mr. Trump denied many of the sensational and unverified claims in the dossier, including any involvement with Russian prostitutes.
He encouraged Mr. Comey to “lift the cloud” by saying publicly that he was not under investigation.
Mr. Comey did not do so.
Finally, on April 11, Mr. Trump called him again and renewed his request.
Mr. Comey said he encouraged the White House counsel to call the Justice Department, following the rules.
Mr. Trump said he would and added, “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing, you know.”
Mr. Comey said he did not ask the president what he meant by “that thing.”
“That was the last time I spoke with President Trump,” Mr. Comey said.
The British prime minister’s blue battle bus had just arrived for a campaign stop at a factory when the booing started.A motley crew of protesters, among them anti-fox-hunting activists and beret-wearing pro-Europeans, greeted Theresa May by playing “Liar, Liar,” the anti-May tune that has become one of the top 100 songs on the U.K. iTunes store, on repeat.
Inside Cross Manufacturing, an aerospace supplier, the blue-collar workers broke into applause only after a questioner asked whether her refusal to debate other candidates on television was a sign of fear and weakness.
“Every vote for me is a vote for the strong and stable leadership which I believe this country needs,” the prime minister responded, going into repeat mode herself.
“Who do you trust to have the strong and stable leadership to get on with that job of getting the best deal for Britain for Brexit, because Brexit really matters?” Britain is having its first national election since the so-called Brexit referendum last June, when the country voted to leave the European Union, a race unfolding in the unsettling glare of two terrorist attacks that killed 29 people in the last three weeks.
It has not quite turned out as Mrs. May had hoped; having tried to make the campaign about the shortcomings of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the race is now as much about her own.
When she called the snap vote seven weeks ago — after insisting for months she had no intention of doing so — Mrs. May seemed unassailable.
Twenty points ahead of her nearest contender in opinion polls, and with most of Britain’s attack-dog tabloids cooing at her every move, the 60-year-old vicar’s daughter appeared a perfect fit for the post-Brexit mood.
A hard-liner on immigration and more skeptical of free markets than any conservative leader in four decades, she vowed to defend her country in Brexit negotiations abroad and to protect the working class from untrammeled capitalism at home.
Gray-haired, unflamboyant, provincial, the very definition of keep-calm-and-carry-on, Mrs. May seemed to be exactly what England wanted.
She even turned an insult by a male conservative colleague — he described her as a “bloody difficult woman” — into a testament to her strong character and promised to live up to it in Brexit negotiations.
But then the campaign started and the polls tightened.
Mrs. May, who had hoped to win a landslide and a mandate going into Brexit negotiations, has proved to be an uninspired retail politician: wooden in manner, ill at ease with voters, flip-flopping on flagship policy proposals and robotically repeating the same rehearsed lines.
Her mantra of “strong and stable” leadership (mentioned four times in her 25-minute appearance in Bath) has been lampooned as “wrong and feeble,” “weak and wobbly” and worse.
An interview she gave to a local paper last week went viral for saying absolutely nothing.
A giant chicken follows her on the campaign trail to remind voters of her refusal to participate in televised debates.
Even her own officials have referred to her as “Theresa May – or Maybe Not.”
Mrs. May is still expected to win, but with her authority diminished.
Even the recent series of terrorist attacks, events that normally rally people around the incumbent, have become a problem for her: As home secretary, Mrs. May was in charge of counterterrorism policy for six years, and this at a time when the Conservatives’ austerity budgets were squeezing funds for policing.
Scrambling, she has taken a tough line in recent days, vowing to keep the country safe, even if it meant changing human rights laws “if they get in the way.”
But as they go to the polls on Thursday, British voters are still trying to figure out who their prime minister is.
Is she the awkward, scripted, hollow candidate who buckles under pressure and is “just not that good,” as one disappointed machine operator in Bath put it?
Or is she, as some would have it, the defining political leader of the Brexit age, a kind of Margaret Thatcher for the 21st century, who will oversee a radical reform of the economic consensus for Britain and beyond?
“We will only find out who Theresa May really is after the election,” said Ceri Thomas, a former editor of the BBC’s flagship “Today” program.
After a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014, a general election in 2015 and last year’s Brexit ballot, this will be the fourth major vote in four years.
“The country is exhausted,” said Rachel Johnson, a writer (and sister of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson) who recently defected from the Conservatives to join the pro-European Liberal Democrats.
“This has been just a depressing exercise in democracy.”
And yet Thursday’s vote is very likely to reshape British politics for years to come.
Whoever wins, Mrs. May or Mr. Corbyn, both are opposed to neoliberalism — the philosophy of rolling back the state and embracing globalization — which has dominated successive governments on left and right for the last 40 years.
Her fans already speak of “Mayism,” an agenda that embraces an anti-immigration stance with a broad rejection of the free market ideology of Thatcherism.
“It’s time to remember the good that governments can do,” Mrs. May said when she introduced her election manifesto.
Just two years ago, when David Cameron was prime minister, the Conservative Party described a cap on energy prices, the flagship policy of the opposition Labour party at the time, as “Marxist.”
Now price controls are Tory policy.
When the Labour Party floated the idea of an 8-pound hourly minimum wage ($10.33), it was derided as a job killer.
Mrs. May now wants it to be 9 pounds an hour ($11.62).
Mrs. May wants to make it harder for foreign companies to buy British businesses.
She wants worker representation on company boards and has put off the date for reaching a budget surplus.
Her plans, economists say, could see the tax burden rise to a 35-year high.
“She is far more radical than Labour recognizes,” said Maurice Glasman, a Labour lawmaker in the House of Lords, Britain’s upper chamber.
“She wants to renew economic democracy.
She is moving into that space.
That is where the country is.”
Mrs. May grew up as the single child of an Anglican clergyman in Oxfordshire, and makes a virtue of not spending frivolously.
She mostly does her own makeup and hair.
Her biggest extravagance is her shoe collection, which receives endless commentary.
On weekends, rather than enjoying the pool and tennis court at Chequers, the official prime minister’s retreat, Mrs. May often returns home to Sonning, in her middle-class Maidenhead constituency, a 45-minute drive from London.
There she goes to church on Sundays with her husband, Philip, (they have no children) and holds an office hour for her constituents on Fridays.
Mrs. May’s conservatism predates Thatcherism: She volunteered for the Conservative Party when she was 12, at a time when the party still believed in a postwar Keynesian consensus of government intervention and a notion of “one-nation Toryism,” a strand of paternalistic conservatism that dates to the 19th century.
In 2002, she gave a speech at the Conservative Party conference, warning fellow Tories: “You know what some people call us: the nasty party.”
More recently, her vision — and that of a very small circle of longstanding and influential advisers — represents a tilt from international-minded London toward Brexit-voting Middle England.
“If you are a citizen of the world,” she said last fall, “you are a citizen of nowhere.”
Mrs. May has embraced the anti-immigrant stance of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party, which has collapsed after achieving its long-term goal of leaving Europe.
By borrowing so liberally from the left and the right, some say Mrs. May is a populist herself.
Not, say, a Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France, but “a lukewarm Anglican version of a populist,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European history at Oxford.
But in her bid to win over the working class she has at times irked her core electorate, the elderly and the home-owning middle classes.
Her most left-wing campaign proposal put a floor of £100,000 on what people of means had to pay for elder care but no cap.
Nicknamed the “dementia tax,” the policy prompted such an outcry that it was discarded within four days.
The flip-flops on this and another prominent proposal — a tax increase on the self-employed, symbolized in the tabloids as the “white van man” — have led some to doubt that the “Red Theresa” image was anything more than an election ploy.
“None of this convinces me that this is a major political figure,” Mr. Garton Ash said.
“I don’t buy it.”
Amid declining poll ratings, Mrs. May has sought to exploit the perceived flaws of her opponent, Mr. Corbyn, a leftist who has advocated nationalizing the rails and some other industries and whom opponents accuse of being soft on terrorism and nuclear deterrence.
When she visited the factory in Bath last week, before the London terror attack, some workers said they were underwhelmed.
“She looked a bit shaky and kept saying the same things,” said Tim Moxey, 36, a machine operator.
Others were more forgiving: “She has been given a hard time and I think she has handled it well,” said Howard Butchers, who said he had never voted Conservative but would this time.
David Goodhart, the author of “The Road to Somewhere,” an influential book about Britain’s values divide, said he still believed Mrs. May could dominate Britain’s political landscape for a generation — not despite her clumsy campaign, but because of it.
“She is unflashy, verging on the inarticulate,” Mr. Goodhart said.
“There is something that is rather appealing to the slightly more middling times.
We’ve done enough admiring of the cognitive elites and their marvelous articulacy.”
“We want something more dowdy,” he said, “because we’re a country in a dowdier mood.”
Rarely has the Trump administration spoken of Iran other than to condemn it as the world’s chief sponsor of terrorism and an aspiring nuclear weapons state.
So when the White House woke on Wednesday to images of a possible Islamic State attack on Tehran, it prompted a sharp quandary: How does President Trump condemn the violence without seeming to embrace the victims?Several administration officials said it took most of the day for the White House to work out the terse, curt wording of a statement that sought to show sympathy for the Iranian public even as it pointedly suggested that the behavior of Tehran’s clerical leaders made its people a target.
“We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times,” Mr. Trump wrote.
“We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.”
The statement capped a day during which Mr. Trump thrust himself into the messy politics of Persian Gulf states, trying to also play peacemaker in a bitter dispute between Qatar and other Sunni Muslim neighbors that threatens to splinter a Middle Eastern alliance fighting the Islamic State.
For the administration, Wednesday served as a reminder that the world does not operate in the black-and-white terms that Mr. Trump used on the campaign trail and on Twitter, one in which the Sunni-dominated Islamic State and Shiite Iran are part of a continuum of “radical Islamic extremism.”
“This is an illustration of the competing priorities and contradictions facing this administration, which will prove hard to reconcile,” said Robert Malley, the top Middle East policy official for the Obama administration.
“You can’t be all-out against Iran, all-out against ISIS and terrorism, and maintain ‘America First’ — another way of saying keeping a light footprint in the region.”
Just a day earlier, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted a series of tweets taking credit for Saudi Arabia’s move to isolate Qatar and appearing to ally with Riyadh.
The president also asked King Salman of Saudi Arabia in a call to draw up a list of grievances for Qatar to address, according to a senior administration official.
That call followed several by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who knows the Sunni gulf leaders from his days as chief executive of Exxon Mobil.
He asked Saudi officials to list the demands they want Doha to meet in return for an end to the dispute, and lift a newly imposed embargo against Qatar by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and several other states.
Inside the administration, Mr. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis repeatedly noted that the United States could not afford a rupture between Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
There are roughly 11,000 American troops at Al Udeid Air Base, outside Doha, where the air war against the Islamic State is managed.
The Qataris were shocked at the contradiction between evenhanded statements from the State Department and Pentagon, and Mr. Trump’s tweets castigating the tiny Gulf state.
They began asking American officials whether their longtime alliance was in peril.
By Wednesday, Mr. Trump offered to invite both sides to the White House and suggested Mr. Tillerson as a mediator.
The president also called the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, to repeat his urgings on Twitter to cut off financing of extremist groups.
While Qatar’s support for those groups — including the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Saudis and the Egyptians consider a serious threat — is without question, the same charge could be leveled at the Saudis, who have allowed funds to flow to other Sunni extremists.
Analysts said Mr. Trump’s public support for Saudi Arabia emboldened the kingdom and sent a chill through other Gulf states, including Oman and Kuwait, that fear that any country that defies the Saudis or the United Arab Emirates could face ostracism as Qatar has.
“Everyone in the region is looking over their shoulder, thinking, ‘This is potentially us,’” said Gerald M. Feierstein, a former ambassador to Yemen who was the State Department’s second-ranking diplomat for Middle East policy from 2013 to 2016.
Mr. Feierstein, now the director for gulf affairs at the Middle East Institute, said that “the bottom line for us is, we have to come out of all this with a consensus on combating terror finance and not blowing the G.C.C. to smithereens,” he said, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council, the loose association of Sunni Arab states.
Among the Saudi complaints about Qatar — mostly that it finances extremists and hosts Al Jazeera, the Arab news channel that is frequently critical of the Saudis — is its episodic cooperation with Iran.
That may add to Mr. Trump’s suspicions about Qatar.
Ultimately, Mr. Trump told the Saudi and Qatari leaders that the campaign against the Islamic State would be more effective with a unified alliance.
Mr. Trump also spoke on Wednesday with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi in the U.A.E., underscoring G.C.C. unity to promote regional stability, “but never at the expense of eliminating funding for radical extremism or defeating terrorism,” according to an administration statement.
Mr. Trump’s hesitant response to the terrorist attack in Iran underscored that the hurdles to pursuing a unified strategy come from Washington as well.
The Trump administration is divided about how to deal with Tehran, and two White House reviews of Iran policy have been grinding ahead for weeks.
The carefully bifurcated White House statement about the onslaught in Iran, which killed 12 and wounded 46, was issued shortly before 4 p.m. in Washington.
More than three hours earlier, the State Department issued its own statement to stoutly condemn the attacks.
“We express our condolences to the victims and their families, and send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Iran,” said a State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert.
“The depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful, civilized world.”
One faction in the National Security Council has been pressing to find ways to sanction Iran, hoping to reimpose economic penalties against Tehran that were lifted after the 2015 nuclear agreement between world powers and the Islamic republic.
But that strategy risks blowing up the accord, which others in the administration — including Mr. Mattis and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster — want to preserve to keep Iran from quickly developing a nuclear weapon.
To date, Iran has complied with the agreement.
But there appears to be no chance, administration officials say, that the Trump administration will try to find common cause with Tehran on fighting the Islamic State.
Nor does there appear to be a strategy yet for managing the growing competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran for dominance of the Middle East.
The result is that while the Trump administration now finds itself in the middle of the Saudi-Qatari dispute, it may soon find itself caught between the Saudis and Iran.
On Wednesday, Tehran accused the Saudis of likely being behind the terrorist attack against the Parliament in Tehran, despite no evidence of such responsibility so far.
“It’s in U.S. interests to try and compel Tehran and Riyadh to address their differences and cooperate against ISIS,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
“Acrimony and distrust between Iran and Saudi Arabia only causes more civilian casualties in Syria and Yemen, more refugees pouring into Europe, and more Sunni and Shia radicalism.”
She was buried Nov. 7, 1970, in plot No. 537 of a potter’s field in Middletown, N.Y.
In the cemetery’s record book, where her name should have been, someone wrote a single word.“Unknown.”
The police had found her a few weeks earlier, dead in the woods.
Her hands had been tied behind her back with a length of electrical cord.
She had been shot, her body left unrecognizable by months of exposure to the elements.
She carried no identification.
For more than 45 years, the woman’s body has lain in a grave marked only by a number on a metal plate.
Then, in late 2015, a breakthrough: The woman’s fingerprints, run through a new police database, were matched to those of a woman arrested several times in the 1960s in Harlem.
But arrest records, a half-century old, brought little clarity.
The woman had several identities, giving the police a new name with each arrest.
One file contained a police photo, possibly mistakenly placed: It appeared to be that of a man.
Instead of leads, state police investigators found only more questions.
She remained, as the cemetery log states, unknown.
An investigation by The New York Times, using public records and data from those old arrest reports, has solved the mystery.
In doing so, the investigation yielded a remarkable life story in reverse, from the woods where the woman died to the streets of Harlem, which were newly flooded in the 1960s with narcotics — streets she walked on her own terms, dressed like a man and ready with quick lies for the police.
Delving further would bring glimpses of her childhood, when she was an infant living on a dirt road in the Deep South.
It is a life of surprising breadth for its length — no more than 30 years.
A woman born into rural poverty made her way to New York City alone, finding a new identity along the way and embracing a bisexuality that, in that day, was more likely to be kept hidden.
Limousines, guns, stolen cars, heroin: She operated on the turf of men who would become the neighborhood’s drug titans a few years later, while at the same time regularly pausing for trips to sit and chat with members of her large family, fellow migrants to the north in search of opportunity.
This is the story of the woman in that cemetery plot, before she became a number.
There was cause for hope among investigators in 1970, picking over that grisly scene in the forest near Chester.
In death, the woman, hands bound, had fallen backward, which served to preserve four of her fingerprints from the ravages of the elements and wildlife.
Two of her fingers were well enough preserved to yield fingerprints using a new method.
A captain with the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation wrote a letter to a medical examiner who oversaw the procedure a week after the body was found, thanking him.
“Without these fingerprints,” the captain, F. G. Dirschka, continued, “I am sure we would have had no success in identifying this body as there was little other physical evidence at the scene.
I am equally sure that our chances are now, of course, greatly enhanced.”
That optimism would prove to be misplaced, with no news for years, then decades.
But in December 2015, fingerprint analysts using the Statewide Automated Biometric Identification System — a new print database then five years old — introduced evidence from cold cases, and when the prints from Jane Doe were entered, the analysts found a match.
The development landed on the desk of Investigator Yan Salomon, of the New York State Police.
Last fall, he asked for the public’s help and shared the arrest reports that were linked to the dead woman.
Specifically, five documents from four arrests in the 1960s.
They formed the pieces of a puzzle — a name on one report, a date of birth on another, an obscure hometown — that, together, led to a promising trail toward the truth.
She gave different names during different arrests.
Most of the names would make sense decades later: Fannie Hill, Evelyn Moore, Shirlene Dixon.
But to get there, other clues in the arrest reports had to first show themselves.
The earliest arrest was in 1967, in Atlantic County, N.J.
The court there produced a typed case history of a criminal proceeding against a defendant named Evelyn Moore, who was charged with embezzlement (a case eventually dismissed) and, six months later, selling narcotics.
The history did not describe the facts behind the cases, only the sentence for the drug arrest: probation, on the condition that Ms. Moore “avoid injurious, immoral or vicious habits” and “persons of disreputable character.”
In what may have been a typo or, as would happen in the years to come, an assumption based on her appearance, she was referred to as “he” in the history.
Records from the two other arrests were provided by the New York Police Department, called modus operandi and “pedigree” reports.
The first was dated Sept. 6, 1968, and recorded the arrest of a woman on West 116th Street in Harlem.
She identified herself as Fannie Hill and was charged with possessing a firearm, a .22-caliber
pistol, according to the arrest report, holding “four live rounds.”
The police found the desk ledger that was in use the night Fannie Hill was brought in for processing, although the date entered, Sept. 16, is different, with the digit 1 perhaps added mistakenly.
She would have stood opposite an officer entering her information into the ledger.
Name: Fannie Hill.
Date of birth: Dec. 3, 1939.
There was a box marked “Nativity.”
In it, the officer wrote the name of a place he probably had never heard of: “Orangeburg, S.C.”
The second and last New York City arrest record was dated eight months later, on May 14, 1969, about a year before the woman found in the woods was believed to have been killed.
The arrest occurred in Harlem again, but this time, the woman said her name was Shirlene Dixon, with an address in the St. Nicholas Houses on Frederick Douglass near 129th Street.
Under occupation, the police wrote, “computer oper.”
The report stated that the woman was caught with 34 glassine envelopes of heroin and was riding in a brand new 1969 Rambler, without the permission of the owner, a car rental company.
But there was a detail of great interest to Investigator Salomon last year in his attempts to close the case.
For the first time in the arrest records, there were names of people with her at the scene, in this case, two men.
The state police determined that one, named Reginald Snow with a long history of thefts to support a drug habit, was likely dead.
The other was a man named Douglas.
The police found his address in Freehold, N.J., and visited him last year.
Douglas looked at the woman’s police photo and said, “I remember her.”
His recollections were the subject of a Times column in November, and they painted the portrait of a living, breathing, vibrant, but nameless character in the city.
Douglas, who asked that his last name be withheld because of the nature of the crime, described the breathless year or so he spent running around with the woman, when he was about 17, she 10 years older.
He knew her by the initials A. C., but didn’t know what they stood for.
She dressed like a man.
“Very fashionable,” Douglas said last year.
“Knit sweaters, sharkskin slacks.”
They were romantic (“Let’s just say we slept together”) even as A. C. pursued other women, and one in particular: Shirlene Dixon, one of the names on the police reports.
Ms. Dixon was then in her early 20s and living with her family in the St. Nicholas Houses.
For some reason, perhaps knowing Ms. Dixon’s record was clean, A. C. had borrowed her lover’s name and address in that 1969 arrest.
Ms. Dixon’s little brother, Greg Dixon, was a boy of 12 or 13 then.
Now 60, he remembered the frequent visitor to their home in a recent interview.
“At first I thought it was a guy,” he said.
“She was nice with my sister and me and my baby sister,” he said.
“She was real cool people.”
The night the woman called herself Fannie Hill, she had told the desk officer in the precinct that she was from Orangeburg, S.C.
It is the name of both a city and the rural county where it sits, about 60 miles from Charleston.
In 2012, the 1940 United States census became available online to the general public, a page-by-page trove for historians and armchair ancestry buffs.
The Times searched the census pages from Orangeburg, looking for any of the names the woman used in New York.
There was a tantalizingly close match to one of the names the woman gave the police, Evelyn Moore.
On one page of the census, among other family members in a crowded house, a female was listed under the name “Moore, Elvin.”
A census worker visited on May 14, 1940, but most of the questions would have sought information as of April 1, 1940, the official date of the census.
Little Elvin was listed as being 4 months old — corresponding to the date of birth of Dec. 3, 1939, that was given by the woman, calling herself Fannie Hill, when she was arrested in 1968.
According to the census, the little girl lived with siblings, aunts, an uncle, a grandmother.
And her mother, a woman with a name that, spelled differently, would appear on that desk blotter years later, perhaps as her daughter thought quickly for an alias.
Fanny.
The little girl had a brother, Jacob, 10, and two sisters, Pearlie and Martha, listed in the census, all older.
Searches for their whereabouts last year were largely fruitless.
Record-keeping was not consistent in poor, black counties like Orangeburg in the middle of the 20th century.
There were others in the house.
The girl’s mother, Fanny, had a brother named Leroy Jones, 19 then, who lived there with his wife, Darcus Jones, 18 — the little girl’s uncle and aunt.
Mr. Jones was listed as a farmer, and Fanny Moore, a “farm laborer,” both reporting zero wages or salary.
They lived near the town of Bowman in Orangeburg County.
Old Reevesville was a dirt road in 1940, and it remained a dirt road earlier this year, when The Times paid a visit.
The road has been renamed Wayside Drive, and part of it had been relocated by several hundred yards.
Walter Minus, 87, grew up on that road, and was 10 in 1940.
He remembered the teenage husband, Mr. Jones — they were lifelong friends.
“Big old wooden house,” Mr. Minus recalled.
“Lots of rooms in it.”
But he did not know them all, and had no recollection of the infant girl.
His father picked cotton and carried it to a market in a horse-drawn cart.
His sister, Janette Minus, 79, remembered other children — “The girls played jacks with peach kernels,” she said — and walking barefoot to the all-black, five-room Bowman Rosenwald School nearby, but did not recall the Moores specifically.
The Moore house seems to have emptied soon after the 1940 census.
Public records show that at some point, the teenage husband and wife, Mr. and Mrs.
Jones, moved to Philadelphia.
Public records show that the Joneses started a family, including two daughters, Barbara and Delores — cousins of the girl “Elvin.”
A telephone number was found for Barbara, now 70, and she answered.
Yes, she said, she did indeed have a cousin, named Evelyn, not Elvin.
She said she hadn’t seen Evelyn in many years and did not know what had become of her.
Evelyn, when she was little, attended the Sleighton Farm School for Girls in Philadelphia, Barbara said, describing it as a place for chronic truants.
After that, Evelyn left Philadelphia for New York.
In the 1960s, when Barbara was a teenager, Evelyn would drop by the family’s house unannounced.
“She would come like once a year with a friend,” she said.
“The person didn’t really come in.
They stayed outside.”
Evelyn dressed exotically — “like a boy,” Barbara said.
Barbara’s sister, Delores, 75, (both women asked that their last names be withheld because of the nature of the crime at the center of this story) remembered the visits as well.
“She’d pop in every now and then,” she said.
“She would speak, ask how everyone was doing, and then disappear.”
Barbara said she did not know what Evelyn did in New York.
She said no one really asked.
“You don’t want to know all that,” she said.
“It’s like you’re getting into their life or whatever.”
Then one day, Evelyn left after a visit and never returned.
The sisters were surprised when, after their father died in 1981, Evelyn did not attend the funeral, but by then they hadn’t seen her in years.
Barbara agreed to look at the 1969 police photo of the woman.
A reporter sent an image to her, and the black-and-white photograph appeared on her phone’s screen.
Barbara looked and gasped.
“My God,” she said.
“Yes.”
She choked out a quick sob and said, “At least now we’re done wondering.”
The state police may soon be done wondering, too, about her identity.
Investigator Salomon located one of little Evelyn’s siblings from the 1940 census: Jacob Moore, 10 years old then, 87 now, living in Philadelphia in the home of his caretaker.
He has been mentally disabled all his life and has relied on the care of others.
He vaguely remembered Orangeburg — “It was country, a farm,” he said in a recent interview.
And he remembered a baby sister.
“She didn’t want to go to school,” he said.
“Hollering so much.”
He did not recognize the police photo or remember seeing his sister grown.
The state police took a swab of his saliva for a DNA comparison to the body in the woods.
The results are pending.
Douglas, the teenager in 1970 who drove around with the woman he called A. C., clearly remembers the last time he saw her.
The two of them had just left Shirlene Dixon’s apartment, and a car approached and stopped.
As he tells it, two “butch” females emerged from the car, grabbed A. C. and drove away.
“That was their world,” he said.
“That was the type of people she was dealing with.”
She never came back.
Life moved on.
“Not that we didn’t like A. C. or miss A. C., because I did,” Douglas said.
“In a world of drugs, people were always coming and going.”
That particular corner of the world of drugs was soon to become notorious.
The arrival of the woman from Orangeburg on the streets of Harlem roughly coincided with that of Leroy Barnes, a living legend in the neighborhood who was better known as Nicky.
In 1965, three years before the record of the woman’s first arrest in Harlem, a newspaper article described Mr. Barnes as “one of the biggest distributors of narcotics in Harlem and the Bronx,” arrested with $500,000 worth of drugs in his possession.
“Me and Jazz covered the West Side,” he wrote in his memoir, “Mr.
Untouchable,” “but only I got the Marketplace on Eighth and 116th, power alley of the Harlem dope scene.
It was just spectacular.”
In 1968, the woman who used the name Fannie Hill was arrested two blocks from that corner, holding the gun with four bullets.
Investigator Salomon said he believed there was enough overlap between these two heroin dealers — one starting out, one king of the neighborhood — that they might have interacted.
Mr. Barnes testified against his former partners and went into the witness protection program in 1998, where he presumably remains, with no news to the contrary.
He would be in his mid-80s.
The state police have appealed to anyone with information on the case to call 845-782-8311.
Or perhaps she passed through the heroin kingpin’s neighborhood of choice as invisibly as she would pass from life a few years later.
Having cycled through her many identities — little baby Evelyn with the misspelled name, and Fannie and Shirlene and A. C. — she would spend a far longer span of time with the label scrawled on the ledger of the potter’s field beside grave No. 537, one both factually lacking and yet wholly accurate in describing who she was, how she came to be in that grave and who put her there.
Unknown.
James B. Comey, the recently fired F.B.I. director, said Thursday in an extraordinary Senate hearing that he believed President Trump had tried to derail an investigation into his national security adviser, and accused the president of lying and defaming him and the F.B.I.Mr.
Comey, no longer constrained by the formalities of a government job, offered a blunt, plain-spoken assessment of a president whose conversations unnerved him from the day they met, weeks before Mr. Trump took office.
The James Comey who emerged during the hearing was by turns humble, folksy and matter-of-fact.
But at the same time, he proved that underneath was a Washington veteran who understood how to tell his story for maximum effect.
In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, he provided an unflattering back story to his abrupt dismissal and raised the question of whether Mr. Trump had tried to obstruct justice.
Answering that falls to the Justice Department special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
Mr. Comey said he had given all of his memos about his interactions with the president to Mr. Mueller, who he believed would look into the possibility of obstruction.
It was the first public suggestion that prosecutors would investigate the president.
“That’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work towards, to try and understand what the intention was there and whether that’s an offense,” Mr. Comey said.
Firing Mr. Comey ignited an unexpected political fire for the president, and Mr. Comey acknowledged helping fan the flames.
He said he had encouraged a friend to give The New York Times details from one of his memos, a move he hoped would lead to the appointment of a special counsel.
It did.
Before firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump was dogged by the F.B.I. inquiry into his campaign’s ties to Russia.
But he was never personally under investigation.
Now, he faces the prospect of an obstruction investigation, inquiries by emboldened congressional officials and questions from both parties about whether he tried inappropriately to end the F.B.I. inquiry into Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser.
Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, flatly denied any obstruction.
“The president never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone,” he said.
But Mr. Kasowitz’s involvement was itself a reflection of how Mr. Comey’s firing had deepened the president’s political and legal difficulties.
Mr. Trump hired him recently to help contain the fallout.
The Senate hearing did not help that effort.
It was the most highly anticipated and crowded congressional event in recent memory.
Over a long career, Mr. Comey has excelled at telling his story while tiptoeing around Washington’s bureaucratic minefields.
He has been so at ease before Congress that some staff members have jokingly called him “Senator Comey.”
But this time, he offered more frank, emotional introspection than he had before.
He set that tone from the beginning, opening with a goodbye to his former employees, to whom he was unable to personally bid farewell.
And he said Mr. Trump had lied — a word that is often soft-pedaled in Washington — when he justified the firing by saying Mr. Comey had lost the confidence of an F.B.I. in disarray.
“Those were lies, plain and simple,” Mr. Comey said.
He said the president had defamed him, an apparent reference to Mr. Trump’s calling him a “nut job” in a private meeting with Russian diplomats.
And when Republicans asked why he had not told the president he was out of line for asking Mr. Comey to “see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Mr. Comey said perhaps he should have.
“I don’t want to make you — sound like I’m Captain Courageous,” he replied.
“I don’t know whether, even if I had the presence of mind, I would have said to the president, ‘Sir, that’s wrong.’”
But he said he had no doubt about Mr. Trump’s intentions.
“I took it as a direction,” he said.
If the president had his way, Mr. Comey said, “we would have dropped an open criminal investigation.”
Mr. Comey’s testimony forced Mr. Trump’s supporters into the uncomfortable position of drawing a distinction between suggesting that the F.B.I. close an investigation into a friend and outright ordering it.
“Knowing my father for 39 years when he ‘orders or tells’ you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,” the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter during the hearing.
Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, is investigating Mr. Flynn along with the broad question of whether the Trump campaign helped Russian operatives meddle in the presidential election.
Next week, as part of a separate investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s staff will interview Jared Kushner, the president’s adviser and son-in-law, Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, said Thursday night.
Mr. Comey placed the origins of the special counsel investigation squarely on Mr. Trump’s Twitter account, a frequent source of conflict for the president.
Two days after Mr. Comey was ousted, The Times reported that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to pledge loyalty to him.
The president then tweeted that Mr. Comey had “better hope that there are no ‘tapes’” of their meetings.
That tweet inspired Mr. Comey to allow a friend to read portions of his memo to The Times.
A day after The Times revealed the contents of that memo, which described the conversation about Mr. Flynn, the Justice Department appointed Mr. Mueller to take over the investigation.
The White House has not commented on whether recordings exist.
But Mr. Comey repeatedly baited Mr. Trump to produce them if they did.
“Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” he said at the hearing.
“The president surely knows if there are tapes.
If there are, my feelings aren’t hurt.
Release the tapes.”
Mr. Trump has offered changing reasons for firing Mr. Comey.
The White House originally cited Mr. Comey’s handling of last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, saying Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, had recommended he be dismissed.
But Mr. Trump quickly undercut that argument, telling NBC News that he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Mr. Comey.
Asked why he was fired, Mr. Comey replied: “I take the president at his word — that I was fired because of the Russia investigation.
Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt, created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve.”
Mr. Comey questioned why Mr. Sessions had been involved in the discussions about his firing, given that Mr. Sessions had recused himself from the Russia case after his undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States were revealed.
“If, as the president said, I was fired because of the Russia investigation, why was the attorney general involved in that chain?”
Mr. Comey asked.
“I don’t know.”
The Justice Department said Thursday that Mr. Sessions had been involved because the firing was related to concerns about Mr. Comey’s leadership and had nothing to do with any inquiry.
Mr. Comey also described his disappointment when the president asked that they be left alone after a meeting in the Oval Office with national security officials.
Mr. Sessions stayed behind at first, but then left.
“My sense was the attorney general knew he shouldn’t be leaving, which is why he was lingering,” Mr. Comey said.
He testified that he later told Mr. Sessions to never again leave him alone with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Kasowitz said Mr. Trump had never sought a loyalty pledge, as Mr. Comey told the Senate.
And he portrayed Mr. Comey as part of a stealth campaign to undermine Mr. Trump.
“It is overwhelmingly clear that there have been and continue to be those in government who are actively attempting to undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications,” he said.
“Mr.
Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakers.”
Mr. Comey’s memo was not classified, and the White House did not assert executive privilege over his conversations with Mr. Trump.
Though Mr. Comey told Mr. Trump three times that he was not under investigation, he said others at the F.B.I. had argued against offering that assurance.
Because the F.B.I. was investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, one official argued, Mr. Trump’s activity would necessarily be scrutinized.
Nevertheless, Mr. Comey said, “I thought it was fair to say what was literally true: There is not a counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump.”
But Mr. Comey said he had distrusted Mr. Trump from the first time they met, at Trump Tower before Inauguration Day.
Mr. Comey ended the day in an F.B.I. vehicle, taking detailed notes about his conversations.
“I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting,” he said, “and so I thought it really important to document.”
Then, in February, when Mr. Trump cleared the Oval Office to talk about Mr. Flynn, Mr. Comey described an ominous feeling.
“My impression was, something big is about to happen,” he said.
“I need to remember every single word that is spoken.”
Upset about the investigation into Russian interference in last year’s election, President Trump sought relief from James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director.
By Mr. Comey’s account, Mr. Trump asked him to help “lift the cloud.”But
thanks to Mr. Trump’s own actions, the cloud darkened considerably on Thursday and now seems likely to hover over his presidency for months, if not years, to come.
Rather than relieve the pressure, Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey has generated an even bigger political and legal threat.
In his anger at Mr. Comey for refusing to publicly disclose that the president was not personally under investigation, legal experts said, Mr. Trump may have actually made himself the target of an investigation.
While delivered in calm, deliberate and unemotional terms, Mr. Comey’s testimony on Thursday was almost certainly the most damning j’accuse moment by a senior law enforcement official against a president in a generation.
In a Capitol Hill hearing room, the astonishing tableau unfolded of a former F.B.I. director accusing the White House of “lies, plain and simple” and asserting that when the president suggested dropping an investigation into his former national security adviser, “I took it as a direction.”
Mr. Comey gave ammunition to the president’s side, too, particularly by admitting that he had orchestrated the leak of his account of his most critical meeting with Mr. Trump with the express purpose of spurring the appointment of a special counsel, which he accomplished.
The president’s defenders said Mr. Comey had proved Mr. Trump was right when he called the former F.B.I. director a “showboat” and a “grandstander,” a conclusion Democrats once shared when he was investigating Hillary Clinton last year.
But Mr. Comey also revealed that he had turned over memos of his conversations with Mr. Trump to that newly appointed special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, suggesting that investigators may now be looking into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by dismissing the F.B.I. director.
“This was a devastating day for the Trump White House, and when the history of the Trump presidency is written, this will be seen as a key moment,” said Peter H. Wehner, who was White House adviser to President George W. Bush.
“My takeaway is James Comey laid out facts and was essentially encouraging Mueller to investigate Trump for obstruction.
That’s a huge deal.”
The White House was left in the awkward position of trying to minimize the damage.
Mr. Trump himself remained uncharacteristically silent, while his advisers kept the daily briefing off camera and sent out the backup to Sean Spicer, the press secretary.
“I can definitively say the president is not a liar,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the principal deputy press secretary, told reporters.
Washington has not seen a spectacle quite like this since the days of Watergate, Iran-contra or President Bill Clinton’s impeachment.
Whatever the controversies under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama, neither was ever accused of personal misconduct by a current or former law enforcement official in such a public forum.
Indeed, Mr. Comey highlighted the difference by noting that he had never taken notes of his conversations with either of those presidents because he trusted their basic integrity, but he did write memos about each of his one-on-one encounters with Mr. Trump because “I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting.”
In any other presidency, the events laid out by Mr. Comey — Mr. Trump asking for “loyalty” from the F.B.I. director who was investigating the president’s associates, then asking him to drop an investigation into a former aide and ultimately firing him when he did not — might have spelled the end.
But Mr. Trump has tested the boundaries of normal politics and upended the usual rules.
To his supporters, the inquiries are nothing more than the elite news media and political establishment attacking a change agent who threatens their interests.
“This is like an explosive presidency-ending moment,” said John Q. Barrett, a law professor at St. John’s University in New York and an associate independent counsel during the Iran-contra investigation in Ronald Reagan’s presidency.
“But we have a different context now.”
The articles of impeachment drafted against President Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Clinton both alleged obstruction of justice, in effect making clear that such an action could qualify under the “high crimes and misdemeanors” clause of the Constitution.
The “smoking gun” tape that doomed Mr. Nixon in 1974 recorded him ordering his chief of staff to have the C.I.A. block the F.B.I. from investigating the Watergate burglary.
Critics said that Mr. Trump’s comments to Mr. Comey effectively cut out the middle man.
The House impeached Mr. Clinton in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, during a sexual harassment lawsuit.
The obstruction alleged in Mr. Clinton’s case was persuading Ms. Lewinsky to give false testimony, advising her to hide gifts he had given her to avoid any subpoena and trying to find her a job to keep her happy.
After a trial, the Senate acquitted him.
As a political matter, both Mr. Nixon and Mr. Clinton faced a House under control of the opposition party, while Mr. Trump has the benefit of a Republican House that would be far less eager to open an impeachment inquiry.
And for all of the fireworks on Thursday, the reaction in Congress still broke down largely along partisan lines, with Democrats in attack mode and Republicans either defending Mr. Trump or remaining silent.
That may leave the question to Mr. Mueller.
“The polarization seems even worse than during the Lewinsky investigation, which I hadn’t thought possible,” said Stephen Bates, an associate independent counsel during the investigation into Mr. Clinton.
“Everyone gets judged in terms of helping or hurting Trump.
Whatever Mueller does, half of the country will call him courageous and half will call him contemptible.
We just don’t know which half is which.”
The defense on Thursday was left to Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, who selectively used Mr. Comey’s testimony, disputing the damaging parts while citing the parts he considered helpful.
He denied that the president had ever asked Mr. Comey for loyalty or to let go of the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser.
But he cited Mr. Comey’s statement that the president himself was not under investigation at the time the F.B.I. director was fired.
He also assailed Mr. Comey for leaking details of his conversations with the president to prompt the appointment of a special counsel, although they were not classified.
“It is overwhelmingly clear that there have been and continue to be those in government who are actively attempting to undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications,” he said.
“Mr.
Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakers.”
Tellingly, the Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee paid no heed to the talking points distributed in advance by the Republican National Committee at the behest of the White House.
Instead of attacking Mr. Comey’s credibility, as the R.N.C. and Donald Trump Jr. did, the Republican senators praised him as a patriot and dedicated public servant.
They largely accepted his version of events, while trying to elicit testimony that would cast Mr. Trump’s actions in the most innocent light possible.
Mr. Comey cooperated to some extent by trying not to go too far beyond the facts as he presented them, declining, for instance, to say whether he thought Mr. Trump’s statements amounted to obstruction of justice.
“In a credibility battle between Trump and Comey, everybody knows Comey is going to win that war,” said Adam W. Goldberg, who was an associate special White House counsel under Mr. Clinton during Kenneth W. Starr’s investigation.
For Mr. Trump, the battle with Mr. Comey now overshadows much of what he wants to do.
Major legislation is stalled.
Mr. Kasowitz said the president was “eager to continue moving forward with his agenda, with the business of this country, and with the public cloud removed.”
For now, though, the cloud remains.
Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain suffered a major setback in a tumultuous election on Thursday, losing her overall majority in Parliament and throwing her government into uncertainty less than two weeks before it is scheduled to begin negotiations over withdrawing from the European Union.Mrs.
May, the Conservative leader, called the snap election three years early, expecting to cruise to a smashing victory that would win her a mandate to see Britain through the long and difficult negotiations with European leaders over the terms of leaving the union.
But according to results reported early Friday morning, the extraordinary gamble Mrs. May made in calling the election backfired.
She could no longer command enough seats to avoid a hung Parliament, meaning that no party has enough lawmakers to establish outright control.
With all but one of the 650 seats in the House of Commons accounted for, the BBC reported that Mrs. May’s Conservatives would remain the largest party.
But they were projected to win only 318 seats, down from the 331 they won in 2015, and eight seats short of a majority.
Britons quickly started wondering whether Mrs. May would have to resign.
One Conservative lawmaker, Anna Soubry, said on national television that it had been a “dreadful campaign” and would force the prime minister to “consider her position.”
The opposition Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, was projected to be on track for 262 seats, up 30 from 2015, significantly elevating Mr. Corbyn’s standing after predictions that his party would be further weakened.
“Whatever the final result, we have already changed the face of British politics,” Mr. Corbyn said.
Last month, in an effort to show “just how much is at stake” in the election, Mrs. May acknowledged that even a small loss of seats would amount to a defeat.
“The cold, hard fact is that if I lose just six seats, I will lose this election, and Jeremy Corbyn will be sitting down to negotiate with the presidents, prime ministers and chancellors of Europe,” she wrote in The Daily Mail.
But early on Friday, Mrs. May hinted that her Conservative Party would try to form a government even if it did not have a majority, arguing that Britain needed “a period of stability.”
If the Conservative Party “has won the most seats and probably the most votes, then it will be incumbent on us,” she said.
The Scottish National Party was projected to fall to 35 seats from 56, while the centrist Liberal Democrats were projected to win 12 seats, up four from 2015.
The forecast raised the prospect that neither major party would be able to form a government without help from another party.
If a coalition cannot be formed, another election could be in the offing.
And there was a wild card.
Northern Ireland’s Sinn Fein party, which won seven seats, said it would not occupy them, in keeping with its longstanding policy.
That would lower the threshold for Mrs. May’s party to establish an effective majority.
The former chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said that for Mrs. May losing a majority would be “completely catastrophic” for her and the Conservative Party.
But he added that it was also difficult to see how the Labour Party could put together a coalition government.
“So it’s on a real knife edge,” he said.
Clearly, Britons confounded expectations and the betting markets once again.
The uncertainty could complicate Britain’s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit.
Negotiations over the withdrawal are scheduled to start in just 11 days.
European leaders want a stable, credible British government capable of negotiating, but Mrs. May’s plea to voters for a strong mandate for Brexit failed badly.
The official outcome of the vote may not be known until lunchtime on Friday.
But the British pound fell sharply after a national exit poll showing that the Conservatives could lose their majority.
Within seconds of the exit poll’s release, the pound lost more than 2 cents against the dollar, falling from $1.2955 to $1.2752.
Simon Hix, a professor of political science at the London School of Economics, said the projections showed the public’s resistance to the complete break from Europe that Mrs. May has championed.
Still, Mrs. May was set to win, he asserted.
“She hasn’t lost this election,” he said.
But Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, said that he was almost speechless at the projections.
If they held, he said, Mrs.
May “is gone.”
“It’s just a matter of time — even if they have a reduced majority,” he continued.
“She asked for a mandate, she expected a strong endorsement, so her judgment is completely under question.”
“She was terrible in the campaign,” he added.
“She is primarily the person who will be seen to be responsible for this.”
Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg Bank in London, also suggested that Mrs. May was in trouble.
“Even if May manages to cling on to a majority, we see a real risk that her leadership is challenged, especially following an unsuccessful election campaign that has managed to both weaken her personal credibility and make far-left Labour leader Corbyn relevant again,” he said as the votes were being counted.
Given the two terrorist attacks that took place during the campaign, security was tight on Thursday as Britons voted, with a heavy police presence.
Maria Balas, 28, a waitress, said security was the prime issue.
“England is under attack and at this time we need a strong leader more than ever,” Ms. Balas said after casting her vote for the governing Conservative Party.
“I don’t like Theresa May, and I wouldn’t have bothered to vote if this election was all about giving her more power to take us into the mess of Brexit, but now we are dealing with a security crisis and I think she is the most qualified person in the running who can deal with that.”
In London’s eastern borough of Hackney, however, young people seemed more concerned about future job prospects.
“The Tories only care about the rich and their interests,” said Luke Wright, 26, who earns £7.50 an hour, or about $9.70, working at a stationery shop.
“If Labour won I’d have a chance to make more cash and get out of this job that I’m overqualified for.”
Mrs. May, 60, rolled the dice on April 18 when she broke her promise not to call an early election, three years ahead of schedule, but did so only because she believed the dice were loaded in her favor.
She went into this election with a 20-point lead in most polls and a working majority of just 17 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament.
While she was personally against Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, in the June 2016 referendum, the vote in favor caused David Cameron to resign, and she emerged as a kind of accidental prime minister.
But she promised voters that she would honor the results of the referendum, using her reputation for toughness “to get the best deal for Britain.”
Now, her decision to call a snap election is raising comparisons to Mr. Cameron’s decision to hold the referendum in the first place.
“May is a policy politician; she does a very good job in office, and she is a lousy campaigner,” said Robert Worcester, the founder of the MORI/Ipsos polling and research organization.
“There was just mistake after mistake after mistake coming through.”
Mrs. May pledged to curtail immigration, an effort to reach out to the nearly 13 percent of voters in 2015 who voted for the U.K. Independence Party, whose platform was anti-immigrant and pro-Brexit.
Many of those voters, especially in the West Midlands and the north, were traditionally Labour supporters, but with the collapse of UKIP, many of them were thought to lean to the Conservatives.
That meant Labour-held seats seemed ripe for the picking, especially since northerners were not enamored of Mr. Corbyn, 68, a far-left urbanite.
He seemed weak on defense and security, shaky on economic management and passionate about places like Venezuela and Nicaragua, and had once had strong sympathies for the Irish Republican Army and liked to make jam.
And the centrist Liberal Democrats, who emphasized rerunning the Brexit debate in a second referendum, were getting very little traction.
While the business elite were laser-focused on the issue of Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, opinion polls showed that the general population had moved beyond that and cared more about domestic issues.
Strangely, for such an important issue, the economic impact of Brexit barely figured in this campaign, perhaps because its strongest effects, should they materialize, will not be felt for some time.
Mrs. May and the Conservatives ran an unusually personal campaign, trying to emphasize the differences between her and Mr. Corbyn on questions of leadership, reliability, economic competence and security, helped by the rabidly anti-Corbyn, pro-Brexit tabloid press.
But the Conservatives did not count on her poor performance on television and shaky presence on the campaign trail, particularly when confronted by hostile questioning.
Rather than “strong and stable,” as her mantra went, Mrs. May could seem brittle and querulous, repeating slogans rather than dipping into substance.
Her party’s manifesto was also vague on figures, and her effort to find more funds for social benefits backfired when she announced, with little consultation with her cabinet colleagues, her intention to charge the better-off more for extended benefits, saying that old people could keep assets up to 100,000 pounds, including the value of their homes.
Quickly labeled “the dementia tax,” it damaged her badly with the Conservatives’ main supporters: older Britons.
“Theresa May doesn’t look happy on the campaign trail,” said Mark Wickham-Jones, professor of political science at the University of Bristol.
“And Labour have proved quite effective at chipping away at things like her reluctance to debate.”
At the same time, Mr. Corbyn, who survived an attempt last year by his own members of Parliament to unseat him as Labour leader, had a very good campaign.
Appealing to the young, especially in the big cities, Mr. Corbyn ran on a platform promising more social justice, free college tuition, more money for the National Health Service and welfare, the re-nationalization of the railways and utilities, and much higher taxes on corporations and those earning over £80,000, about $104,000, a year.
His performances on television were calm and avuncular, with a touch of humor.
And as the campaign wore on, he appeared to win back the support of most Labour voters in 2015, plus some Liberal Democrats and Greens.
The polls narrowed.
But the Conservatives never lost their lead in any major poll.
And party professionals on the ground, especially in marginal seats in the Midlands and the north that the Conservatives had targeted, reported continuing resistance to Mr. Corbyn as a credible prime minister.
The campaign was also marred by two terrorist attacks that caused numerous casualties, in Manchester on May 22 and then, last Saturday, in London.
These also seemed to work against Mrs. May, at least at first.
As home secretary for six years before becoming prime minister, she was criticized for the security services’ failure to stop the plots and for supporting cuts in beat policing.
Yet, late polling indicated that she benefited from her tough response — especially after the London attack, when she promised new counterterrorism legislation — and had widened the gap with Labour at the end.
The candidates spent the last day of official campaigning racing around the country — Mrs. May by jet, Mr. Corbyn by train.
“They underestimated us, didn’t they?” he told a rally in Glasgow.
If one believes James B. Comey’s account of his encounters with President Trump, it could present a prosecutable case of obstruction of justice, several former prosecutors said Thursday.But they also cautioned that little is normal about this situation.
The Justice Department has long argued that the Constitution does not permit prosecuting a sitting president.
And even if Mr. Trump left office first — through impeachment, or simply by losing re-election in 2020 — there is no guiding precedent in which any former president has been indicted on a charge of ordering a criminal investigation closed for improper reasons.
“Usually as a lawyer you look at the precedent and it makes it easy, but it hasn’t come up before,” said Samuel W. Buell, a former federal prosecutor who led the Enron task force and now teaches white-collar criminal law at Duke University.
“We are way outside the realm of normal executive branch behavior.”
Federal law criminalizes actions that impede official investigations and can include actions that would otherwise be lawful if prosecutors can prove the defendant had corrupt intentions.
Mr. Trump’s critics have been raising the specter of obstruction of justice since he fired the F.B.I. director, Mr. Comey, last month, then admitted on television that when he made that decision, he had been thinking about the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination by Trump campaign associates.
But Mr. Comey’s testimony on Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee sharpened obstruction-of-justice questions while refocusing them on an earlier conversation Mr. Comey said he had with Mr. Trump on Feb. 14 about an F.B.I. criminal investigation of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser.
Specifically, according to Mr. Comey’s testimony, after he met that day with Mr. Trump and others in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump ordered all the other officials out of the room — twice reiterating to lingerers, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, that they were to leave.
Then, Mr. Comey said, Mr. Trump brought up Mr. Flynn, calling him a “good guy” and saying, “I hope you can let this go.”
“I took it as a direction,” Mr. Comey testified Thursday.
“I mean, the president of the United States, with me alone, saying, ‘I hope this’ — I took it as, This is what he wants me to do.”
Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, responded to Mr. Comey, “You may have taken it as a direction, but that’s not what he said.”
Mr. Risch also suggested that no one had ever been prosecuted for obstruction of justice based on saying, “I hope.”
In fact, there have been several cases showing it is possible to obstruct justice using those words.
In a 2008 case involving a man who had pleaded guilty to bank robbery, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, upheld a judge’s decision to impose a longer sentence because the man had also obstructed justice by telling his girlfriend, a potential witness, “I hope and pray to God you didn’t say anything about a weapon.”
“We have examples all the time in criminal law of people saying things only slightly subtly, where everyone understands what is meant — ‘Nice pair of legs you got there; shame if something happened to them,’” Mr. Buell said.
In a statement shortly after the hearing, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, acknowledged that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey about Mr. Flynn and had said that the former national security adviser was a “good guy.”
But he denied that Mr. Trump had said or implied anything to Mr. Comey about stopping the investigation.
“The president never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone, including suggesting that Mr. Comey ‘let Flynn go,’” Mr. Kasowitz said.
Still, Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor who is now a white-collar defense attorney and a partner at Thompson Coburn, said that the level of detail Mr. Comey offered — in particular, the accumulation of nuggets about how Mr. Trump cleared the room, showing how important it was to the president to have no one else present — was “stronger than what we heard before” as evidence of nefarious intent.
But defense lawyers could still argue for a benign interpretation, Mr. Mariotti said, and he suggested that while the publicly available evidence was sufficient for a United States attorney’s office to consider bringing an obstruction case if it involved a business executive or a low-level political figure, the higher stakes of going after a president would give prosecutors pause.
They would recognize, he said, “that it’s a hard case and you might lose.”
“Based only on what we know now in public, a reasonable prosecutor might bring this case against an ordinary person,” he said.
“But a prudent prosecutor would want more facts before bringing this case against a president.”
The Justice Department has not said whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is looking into any obstruction by Mr. Trump in addition to his mandate to examine Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination by Trump campaign associates.
But Mr. Comey said on Thursday that he had given his memos recounting conversations with Mr. Trump to Mr. Mueller, which would appear only to be relevant to an obstruction inquiry.
Julie O’Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches white-collar criminal law at Georgetown University, said there may yet be more to learn from Mr. Flynn that could connect the Feb. 14 episode to the broader legal questions raised by the Russia investigation.
If Mr. Trump did ask Mr. Comey to drop the Flynn case, she asked why he would do so.
“My supposition as a prosecutor would be that Flynn has something on the president,” she added.
“You will recall that Flynn asked for immunity, saying that he has a story to tell.
Perhaps the president believed that ending the investigation meant that Flynn would never tell that story.
I assume investigators will be delving into this, as it is clearly relevant to whether the president acted with a corrupt intent in trying to derail the Flynn investigation.”
President Trump scrambled American diplomacy on two fronts on Friday, delivering a stinging rebuke of Qatar at the very moment his secretary of state was trying to mend fences in the Persian Gulf, while at the same time reaffirming support for NATO two weeks after he had declined to do so.Unpredictable as always, Mr. Trump’s comments cut in two directions: He appeared to undermine Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who has thrown himself into an effort to mediate a resolution to the bitter dispute between Qatar and several of its neighbors, chiefly Saudi Arabia.
But he also soothed NATO allies by explicitly reaffirming Article 5, the clause that commits members to defend any ally under attack.
Mr. Trump conspicuously avoided making that pledge at a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels two weeks ago, opening a rift with allies that widened after he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord.
Yet the pattern of sudden reversals in the Trump administration’s diplomacy was most pronounced in the Middle East.
On Friday afternoon, Mr. Tillerson called for a “calm and thoughtful dialogue” to resolve the deepening dispute among Sunni Muslim states in the Persian Gulf.
Barely an hour later, Mr. Trump’s comments were anything but that.
He accused Qatar of being a “funder of terror at a very high level” and demanded that the tiny, energy-rich nation cut off that money flow to rejoin the circle of responsible nations.
“We had a decision to make,” Mr. Trump declared at a Rose Garden news conference with the president of Romania, Klaus Iohannis.
“Do we take the easy road or do we take a hard but necessary action?” he said.
“We have to stop the funding of terrorism.”
A senior administration official insisted that Mr. Trump was “on the same page” as his secretary of state, even distributing a page to reporters on Air Force One that showed their statements on Qatar side by side.
He also disputed that Mr. Trump’s comments about Article 5 represented a reversal, arguing, as the White House has before, that the president had already effectively endorsed it.
But on Qatar, a senior adviser to Mr. Tillerson, R.C. Hammond, suggested a difference in emphasis — if not ultimate goal — between the two men.
“The president is focused on ending terrorism; the secretary is focused on diplomacy that will return G.C.C. focus to fighting terrorism,” he said, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council, a loose association of mostly Sunni Arab states.
The mixed messages extended to the Pentagon, which issued a statement reaffirming Qatar’s critical role as a military partner to the United States and expressing concern that the deepening instability would hurt the American-led campaign against the Islamic State.
Qatar is home to two major American command posts, including a center from which the United States and its allies conduct their air war on Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
“While current operations from Al Udeid Air Base have not been hindered or curtailed, the evolving situation is hindering our ability to plan for longer-term military operations,” said Capt.
Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, naming the large military installation in Qatar.
A senior administration official played down those concerns, saying that the dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia would pose a problem to American military operation only if it drags on over time.
At the moment, a blockade on land crossings into Qatar mostly threatens food deliveries and sundered families, said the administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Whether deliberately or accidentally, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump appear to have taken on a sort of good-cop, bad-cop role.
For Mr. Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil who has deep contacts in the Persian Gulf, Qatar has emerged as an early test of his diplomatic skills.
His approach was to try to lower the temperature on all sides.
“We ask that there be no further escalation by parties in the region,” he said just hours after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates listed 59 people and a dozen organizations linked to Qatar, including prominent Qatari businessmen, politicians and royalty, as aiding terrorism.
The blacklisting deepened a five-day standoff that has included a cutoff of all diplomatic relations, travel and trade with Qatar, forcing the country to import critical food supplies by air from Turkey and elsewhere.
Mr. Tillerson noted that the standoff has already had serious humanitarian consequences, including food shortages, family separations and children being pulled out of school.
Military operations in the region have also been affected, as has the functioning of American and international businesses, he said.
Mr. Tillerson’s initial attempt at negotiations was nearly upended by Mr. Trump, who first inserted himself into the dispute with a series of Twitter posts that seemed to put the United States squarely on the side of the Saudis.
“During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,” he wrote.
“Leaders pointed to Qatar — look!”
The president’s remarks on Friday appeared to reinforce that impression.
After criticizing Qatar, Mr. Trump lavished praise on Saudi Arabia’s monarch as “my friend, King Salman,” who played host at what the president called a historic summit meeting in Riyadh during his visit there last month.
“There has never been anything like it before,” he said, “and perhaps there never will be again.”
But Mr. Trump’s remarks fueled Qatar’s adversaries.
In a statement, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba, welcomed the presidents’ comments and said, “Qatar can no longer have it both ways.”
Mr. Tillerson said the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, had made progress in cutting off funding to groups linked to terrorism.
“But he must do more, and he must do it more quickly,” Mr. Tillerson added.
He said the United States supported efforts by the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, to resolve the dispute.
But Mr. Tillerson called on countries in the region to “immediately take steps to de-escalate the situation.”
Qatari officials have repeatedly denied supporting terrorist groups and say the emirate works closely with Western security agencies to crack down on the financing of terrorism.
American officials are dubious of those claims, though they agree that Qatar has made progress.
Inside the administration, Mr. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have argued that the United States cannot afford a rupture between Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Middle East, on one side, and Qatar on the other.
On Thursday, the two men had breakfast together and then went to the White House for a meeting with Mr. Trump, who officially offered Mr. Tillerson as a mediator in the dispute.
Mr. Trump’s statement on NATO will make life easier for Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis.
The president’s refusal to endorse Article 5 — a reluctance that dates back to the 2016 campaign, when he questioned the underpinnings of the alliance — had strained America’s relationship with its NATO allies at a time when the United States is pressing them to contribute a greater share of troops to the international military force in Afghanistan.
Members of Mr. Trump’s national security team expected him to offer an explicit endorsement during his visit to NATO headquarters two weeks ago.
When he did not, it underscored his willingness to deviate from his advisers on core foreign policy principles.
“Shouldn’t be a big deal,” Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a research and consulting firm, tweeted on Friday about Trump’s explicit commitment to Article 5. “But it is.”
When companies settle claims of wrongdoing, they are often compelled to pay for environmental or community development projects as well as pay fines and direct compensation to victims.
Sometimes the third-party payments are only marginally related to the damages caused by the company’s actions.To settle claims from the Gulf oil spill, BP was required to spend billions on coastal restoration projects that were not directly related to spill damage.
Volkswagen is financing electric vehicle charging stations under its settlement of the diesel emissions cheating scandal.
Duke Energy paid for soil restoration on federal land as part of its compensation for air pollution violations at some of its power plants in North Carolina.
That longstanding practice is now under attack on two fronts, potentially jeopardizing a source of financing for initiatives across the country that supporters say have paid great environmental and social dividends.
Critics say the practice effectively creates “slush funds” for favored organizations or causes.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a memo issued this week, directed the Justice Department to no longer include funding for projects managed by outside groups in settlements with corporate wrongdoers.
The settlement money will instead go exclusively to the federal Treasury or to victims of the company’s actions, Mr. Sessions said.
“It has come to my attention that certain previous settlement agreements involving the department included payments to various nongovernmental, third-party organizations as a condition of settlement with the United States,” Mr. Sessions said.
“These third-party organizations were neither victims nor parties to the lawsuits.
The department will no longer engage in this practice.”
The policy applies only to future cases.
A bill with similar intent, sponsored by Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, passed a House committee in February.
It would prevent the government from using settlement money from civil cases for purposes other than direct victim compensation or remediation, like cleanups of environmental disasters.
A version of the bill passed the House last year, but died in the Senate.
This year, groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Americans for Prosperity, both closely linked to the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, wrote to President Trump criticizing a recent settlement between the Obama administration’s Justice Department and Volkswagen.
The $14.7 billion settlement, over Volkswagen’s use of “defeat devices” to cheat emissions rules, included almost $2 billion that Volkswagen was required to invest in electric vehicle charging stations and other clean vehicle technology.
The settlement also directed Volkswagen to pay $2.7 billion to programs that would reduce pollution from diesel cars and trucks.
Volkswagen had been accused of manufacturing cars that spewed harmful nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the levels allowed under the Clean Air Act.
Some of the money was in effect going to pay for clean air initiatives championed by President Barack Obama, the conservative groups said, initiatives that Congress twice refused to fund.
“Having been twice spurned by lawmakers, the Obama administration leveraged the Volkswagen settlement,” the groups charged.
All settlement money, they argued, should “instead be deposited into the U.S. Treasury.”
The groups said that Congress has not authorized or provided money for electric vehicle infrastructure.
They said the plan represents “an end-run around Congress’s lawmaking power.”
Such settlement funds can be appropriate in cases of environmental wrongdoing, some environmental lawyers said, because the victims are often scattered over large areas or are difficult to identify and compensate directly.
At times, the government has ordered a polluter to pay for unrelated environmental restoration projects as restitution; the attorney general’s order would prohibit such deals.
Environmental groups say that settlement funds have gone to critical projects nationwide.
The 2012 settlement with BP, in which it agreed to pay to resolve criminal charges, included more than $2 billion for projects aimed at environmental restoration in the Gulf of Mexico, and research into spill prevention and other topics.
A 2015 settlement with Duke Energy allocated $4.4 million to stream and river ecosystem restoration in North Carolina.
“You’re killing something that’s worked really well — which is getting violators who’ve broken the law, in some cases in a criminal way, to agree to fund projects to make the air or water cleaner,” said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and the former director of civil enforcement at the Environmental Protection Agency.
“What’s wrong with that?”
Mr. Sessions’ new policy directs Justice Department lawyers not to include similar payments in settlements with corporations.
“The goals of any settlement are, first and foremost, to compensate victims, redress harm, or punish and deter unlawful conduct,” he said in his memo, dated June 5.
The House bill, known as the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, would turn that policy into law, making it difficult for future administrations to reverse.
Mr. Goodlatte, who co-sponsored the bill, cited the government’s settlement with Volkswagen as an example of the abuse of settlement funds.
He also referred to a deal that required Credit Suisse to originate affordable housing loans that generate a minimum of $240 million in credit as part of a settlement related to its handling of mortgages before the global financial crisis.
Mr. Goodlatte called that “effectively a donation in the guise of a loan.”
Credit Suisse declined to comment.
Frank Holleman, a senior lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that if settlement money for environmental violations goes to the Treasury Department, it may be spent on something else, and prevent restoration of or protection of an affected community or ecosystem.
“You can’t just dump money in the river and it gets clean,” he said.
“You have to contribute to a nonprofit that does the work to make it that way.
It‘s not just being thrown away or given to these entities — it’s payments for a particular service.”
The money has gone to a variety of environmental projects.
In 2015, Duke Energy, a North Carolina utility, reached a settlement with the Department of Justice over claims that it had violated the Clean Air Act at five of its power plants in the state.
The settlement, which contained provisions to prevent further air pollution, including shutting down coal-fired electricity generating units, also required the company to pay a civil penalty and $4.4 million toward environmental mitigation projects.
The mitigation projects included ecosystem restoration — soil restoration in national forests, and restoration of a trout population, or revegetation of Red Spruce trees — and electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy efficiency programs in poor areas.
Neil Nissan, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said the utility does not take a position on the policy or the bill.
One of the projects the BP settlement money has funded is the restoration of more than 13 miles of beach along a geographical feature known as the Caminada Headlands, which will provide storm protection for Port Fourchon, La., and other nearby areas.
BP declined to comment.
David M. Uhlmann, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and the former chief of the environmental crimes section at the Justice Department, said, “The attorney general’s directive prohibits those laudable third-party payments and, in doing so, needlessly undermines public health and environmental protection efforts.”
He added, ”Congress can and should rely on the Justice Department and regulatory agencies to ensure that companies who commit regulatory violations make appropriate payments to remedy the harm they have caused.”
President Trump on Friday accused James B. Comey, the fired F.B.I. director, of lying under oath to Congress, saying he would gladly provide sworn testimony disputing Mr. Comey’s charge that the president forced him out because of his handling of the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russia.Mr.
Trump asserted that the comments on Thursday by Mr. Comey, whom he called “a leaker,” had proved that there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow, nor any obstruction of justice by the president.
He hinted again that he had tapes of his private talks with the former F.B.I. chief that would disprove Mr. Comey’s account, but declined to confirm the existence of any recordings.
“Yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction,” Mr. Trump said in the White House Rose Garden, during a news conference with the visiting Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis.
He dismissed Mr. Comey’s testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which is investigating whether his campaign worked with Russia to sway the election, as a politically motivated stunt orchestrated by adversaries bitter about his victory in November.
“That was an excuse by the Democrats, who lost an election that some people think they shouldn’t have lost,” he said.
“But we were very, very happy, and, frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things that he said just weren’t true.”
The remarks were a defiant response from Mr. Trump, who had remained uncharacteristically silent on social media during Mr. Comey’s blockbuster day of testimony on Thursday, as the former F.B.I. chief laid out an account that strongly suggested the president’s private exchanges with him had been an attempt to obstruct justice.
They escalated an extraordinary public feud between a sitting president and the ousted F.B.I. director who had been investigating his campaign, each now engaging in full-throated accusations that the other is lying.
But Mr. Trump’s comments reflected a highly selective reading of Mr. Comey’s testimony, much of which painted a damaging picture of the president’s conduct.
Mr. Comey told Congress that the president had not personally been under investigation while he was the F.B.I. director, and that at one point Mr. Trump suggested he would like to find out whether any of his associates had done anything wrong.
But his account also strongly suggested that Mr. Trump had tried to influence his handling of the Russia inquiry.
Mr. Trump denied that he had ever asked Mr. Comey to drop the F.B.I. investigation into his former national security adviser’s dealings with Russia, or asked for a pledge of loyalty, as Mr. Comey asserted Thursday.
Those conversations are reflected in memos Mr. Comey wrote, and now are in the possession of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation who was named after Mr. Comey’s firing.
“I didn’t say that,” Mr. Trump said of the request regarding the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.
“And there’d be nothing wrong if I did say it.”
Of the loyalty pledge from Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump said, “I hardly know the man; I’m not going to ask him to pledge allegiance.”
Asked whether he would be willing to provide his version under oath, Mr. Trump responded, “100 percent.”
He said of Mr. Mueller, “I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you.”
The president declined repeatedly to say whether, as he suggested last month in a Twitter post, he had recordings of his conversations with Mr. Comey.
“I’ll tell you about it over a very short period of time,” he said.
“You’re going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer.”
The tantalizing comment appeared to catch the attention of congressional investigators participating in the Russia probe.
Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, and Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, quickly announced they had written to Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, requesting that any recordings or memos about Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Comey be furnished to the intelligence committee within two weeks.
They also said they had made a formal request to Mr. Comey for copies of the memos he testified about on Thursday or notes reflecting the meetings.
During his Senate testimony on Thursday, Mr. Comey said he relished the idea of recordings of his conversations with Mr. Trump becoming public, saying, “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” and seeming to taunt the president at one point, remarking, “Release all the tapes — I’m good with it.”
Mr. Comey testified that it was Mr. Trump’s May 12 Twitter post suggesting there were such tapes that prompted him to ask an intermediary to share information with a reporter from a memo he had created about his interactions with the president.
The New York Times was read portions of the memo and on May 16 published an article, in which it was revealed that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to drop the Flynn matter.
Earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that Mr. Comey had given him “vindication” in the Russia investigation.
“Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication,” he wrote at 6:10 a.m.
He added, “and WOW, Comey is a leaker,” referring to the former F.B.I. director’s admission that he had orchestrated the leak of the contents of a memo detailing Oval Office discussions with the president to The Times through a friend.
The president also recirculated another defense of his actions posted on Twitter by Alan M. Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus who has advised the Trump team on Middle Eastern policy.
“We should stop talking about obstruction of justice,” Mr. Dershowitz said, linking to an interview he gave to Fox News.
“No plausible case.
We must distinguish crimes from pol sins.”
Mr. Trump’s team, led by his personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, on Friday was preparing a counterattack on Mr. Comey based in part on his admission that he arranged the leak of his account of the conversation with Mr. Trump in which he says the president suggested the F.B.I. halt its investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser.
The president’s lawyers plan to file a complaint with the Justice Department inspector general next week arguing that Mr. Comey should not have shared what they call privileged communications, according to two people involved in the matter.
The lawyers also plan to send a complaint to the Senate Judiciary Committee raising questions about Mr. Comey’s previous testimony to that panel.
On May 3, in response to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee chairman, Mr. Comey said he had never been an anonymous source for news outlets about the investigation involving Mr. Trump’s team or authorized anyone at the F.B.I. to be.
In his testimony on Thursday, Mr. Comey said the memo whose contents he had a friend leak was not classified and therefore not inappropriate to make public.
Mr. Trump’s lawyers argue that it was subject to executive privilege, although the president has never asserted privilege over his conversations with Mr. Comey and independent legal experts have expressed doubt that he could.
Mr. Comey arranged the leak on May 15, after he was fired and after the May 3 hearing, so it would not be in direct conflict with that testimony.
